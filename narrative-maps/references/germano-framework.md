# William Germano's Mapping Framework

*From "On Revision: The Only Writing That Counts" - Chapter: "Know What You've Got" - Section: "Map"*

## The Map Concept

### Maps Work Spatially

Your writing **travels** (remember the stages metaphor). Think of your prose as occupying **space**—whether on the screen or on the page. Words laid out one after another create geographic territory.

Some parts of your draft are:

- **Flat, easily crossed stretches**: Components you understand well and can effectively connect to what surrounds them
- **Mountainous or broken by impassable canyons**: Parts that feel difficult or unclear—"How do I get from here to there?"

The map helps you see this terrain from above, like viewing the territory from thirty-five thousand feet.

### Maps Show What You've Got So Far

A map is a **picture** of your writing in progress, not a plan for future writing. It shows:

- **Components**: episodes, people, histories, theories, ideas
- **Spatial relationships**: how these components are positioned in the geographic space of your text
- **Movement through space**: how you manipulate components, moving them through your text

As Germano notes: "The map works spatially. It considers prose as if it occupied space, which it does, whether on the screen or on the page."

### Maps Define Borders

Every writing project has **borders**—boundaries that define:

- **What's in scope**: The territory you need to explore
- **What's out of scope**: Territory that might be interesting but shouldn't become the focus

As Germano writes: "You will know where the uncharted territory of your writing lies. There's the part of the world that you need to explore, and the part that might be interesting but shouldn't become a focus of your current writing project."

Like medieval maps warning "Here be dragons," your map shows you where the dangers and unknown territories are.

## Important Principles

### Spatial Thinking

Think of your prose as occupying **space**:
- Words laid out one after another create geographic territory
- Components (episodes, ideas, theories) exist in spatial relationships
- You manipulate these components by moving them through space

### Temporal Tracking

- Number pages in every draft
- Record word count
- Update at the end of each writing day
- Date each version
- This isn't obsessive—it's creating a practice of logging your spatial progress

### Intermediate Labeling

Give names to sections even if they're temporary. This:
- Announces what a section is about
- Builds your knowledge of your own text
- Helps you think about sequences as elements with obligations and capacities
- Some labels will be temporary, others may become subheads

### Multiple Passes

Map the draft multiple times:
- Divisions you create on first pass may change
- Shapes and misshapes emerge gradually
- Conviction about structure builds over iterations
- Don't worry if marked sections vary in size (some will be paragraphs, others many pages)

### Discovery Mode

The map is for **discovery**, not immediate repair:
- You're getting a view from altitude
- You'll be itching to rewrite underdeveloped islands
- Resist the itch
- Discovery stage = seeing what's there
- Repair comes later

### Fluidity and Process

- Labels that felt right may later feel out of place (move, reword, or cut them)
- Revision is about fluidity
- Focus on process, not perfection
- The map evolves as the draft evolves

## Examples from Germano

### Example 1: Women's Soccer Working Titles

"I want to write about women's soccer" is too vague. A working title insists on articulating your approach:

- "Compensation inequities in women's soccer" signals one angle
- "Hands off women's work" signals a different angle

Either might be right, but the difference shapes every paragraph that follows.

**Key insight**: Even at the earliest stage, try not to settle for something vague. A working title:
- Insists on telling you something about your subject
- Shapes how you're writing about it
- Makes you articulate your angle or approach

### Example 2: Unemployment Study Borders

> "I am writing a study of unemployment in this period, in this geographical region, in this industry, in this socioeconomic community."

The writer has **mapped the terrain**:
- Temporal border: "this period"
- Spatial border: "this geographical region"
- Topical borders: "this industry," "this socioeconomic community"

As Germano explains: "The writer has just described or mapped the terrain of this analysis. The project does not intend to engage material outside this period, region, industry, or community except as supporting or comparable data. Its focus will be limited and enriched by that limitation."

By articulating borders, "you develop a clearer sense of what you will be doing."

### Example 3: Intermediate Labeling

A writer goes through a draft and marks:
- Page 17: "Community responses"
- Pages 20-25: "Community responses—the cost of bottled water, food"
- Pages 26-30: "Community responses—how does this build on the previous section? Is it really 'community' I'm talking about or particular officials from the opposition?"

The writer is:
- Identifying small islands of prose
- Labeling them (even tentatively)
- Building knowledge of their own text
- Discovering that labels might shift or need refinement

Some labeled sections occupy very little space (a couple of paragraphs), others go on for many pages. That will change, but making marks helps identify the parts.

## What Mapping Helps Writers Do

Mapping helps writers:
- Visualize the spatial structure of writing
- Understand what components occupy which parts of the text
- Identify flat, easily crossed stretches vs. mountainous or broken terrain
- Find the borders of the project (what's in scope vs. out of scope)
- Locate dangers and uncharted territory ("here be dragons")
- See where they need to go and how to get there
- Track word counts and page numbers as they develop
- Label and name sections to build knowledge of their own text
- Identify natural breaks, shifts, and transitions
- Discover repetitions, recursive passages, and misplaced elements

## Integration with Other Revision Tools

As Germano concludes the chapter:

> "Now make the process your own. Analyze your draft and plot your next steps. Review your archive, think through inventory, keywords, and map: use these tools separately or together, in whatever way that they can help. See where they reinforce your most important concepts and arguments. Go back and forth, checking what this one tells you and whether this other one agrees or tells you something different. Use every tool available whether you're revising a single unit (essay or chapter) or a compound one (a book manuscript composed of multiple units). Because in revising, the point is knowing what you have—really have—so that you can figure out what's missing or what's there and shouldn't be."

## Key Quotes

"The real work of mapping a draft begins with giving it a title."

"The map works spatially. It considers prose as if it occupied space, which it does, whether on the screen or on the page."

"You will know where the uncharted territory of your writing lies. There's the part of the world that you need to explore, and the part that might be interesting but shouldn't become a focus of your current writing project."

"The discovery stage of revision should be 'a view from thirty-five thousand feet of the territory below'—NOT 'a moment to land and repaint the barn.'"
