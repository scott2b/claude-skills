# Narrative Maps

This skill helps writers map their draft text using William Germano's spatial framework from *On Revision*. A map is a picture of what you've written so far—a way to visualize the geographic space your prose occupies and to navigate the terrain from "here" to "there."

## Purpose

Just as an **inventory** is a catalogue of elements (materials, ideas, emphases) that may or may not belong in the finished project, a **map** is a picture of what you've written so far.

Mapping helps you:
- Visualize the spatial structure of your writing
- Understand what components occupy which parts of your text
- Identify flat, easily crossed stretches vs. mountainous or broken terrain
- Find the borders of your project (what's in scope vs. out of scope)
- Locate dangers and uncharted territory ("here be dragons")
- See where you need to go and how to get there
- Track word counts and page numbers as you develop
- Label and name sections to build knowledge of your own text
- Identify natural breaks, shifts, and transitions
- Discover repetitions, recursive passages, and misplaced elements

As Germano notes: "The map works spatially. It considers prose as if it occupied space, which it does, whether on the screen or on the page."

## When to Invoke This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- You've completed a draft and want to see its structure visually
- You feel lost in your own text and need a high-level view
- You're unsure about the borders and scope of your project
- You want to identify which sections are working vs. problematic
- You need to see how components are distributed across your text
- You're planning how to navigate from one section to another
- You want to track your progress and understand your text's geography
- You need to identify natural divisions and potential reorganization

## The Map Concept (from Germano)

### Maps Work Spatially

Your writing **travels** (remember the stages metaphor). Some parts of your draft are:
- **Flat, easily crossed stretches**: Components you understand well and can effectively connect to what surrounds them
- **Mountainous or broken by impassable canyons**: Parts that feel difficult or unclear—"How do I get from here to there?"

The map helps you see this terrain from above, like viewing the territory from thirty-five thousand feet.

### Maps Show What You've Got So Far

A map is a **picture** of your writing in progress, not a plan for future writing. It shows:
- **Components**: episodes, people, histories, theories, ideas
- **Spatial relationships**: how these components are positioned in the geographic space of your text
- **Movement through space**: how you manipulate components, moving them through your text

### Maps Define Borders

Every writing project has **borders**—boundaries that define:
- **What's in scope**: The territory you need to explore
- **What's out of scope**: Territory that might be interesting but shouldn't become the focus

As Germano writes: "You will know where the uncharted territory of your writing lies. There's the part of the world that you need to explore, and the part that might be interesting but shouldn't become a focus of your current writing project."

Like medieval maps warning "Here be dragons," your map shows you where the dangers and unknown territories are.

## Task Instructions

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Detect Environment & Understand Context

**First, determine your environment:**
- If you have access to a project directory and file system tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep): You are in **Claude Code**
- If the user uploaded files or you're working in a chat without direct project access: You are in **Claude Desktop/Web**

**Then understand the writing context:**
1. Ask the user which draft or section they want to map
2. In Claude Code: If not specified, search for main writing files in the project
3. In Claude Desktop: Ask the user to share the draft text (upload file or paste text)
4. Read the draft text to understand its scope and content

### Step 2: Build the Basic Map Infrastructure

**Number the pages** (or track existing page numbers):
- Record the current word count
- If a book-length draft, keep a running tab of each separate chapter
- Date this information at the top of the draft

Create a basic structural record:
```
Draft: [Name]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Total word count: [number]
Total pages: [number] (or estimated based on word count)

Structure:
- Chapter/Section 1: [word count], pages [X-Y]
- Chapter/Section 2: [word count], pages [X-Y]
- etc.
```

This creates a spatial framework—you now know the dimensions of your territory.

### Step 3: Title Everything

**Give the draft a working title** if it doesn't have one. As Germano emphasizes: "The real work of mapping a draft begins with giving it a title."

Even at the earliest stage, try not to settle for something vague like "an essay I want to write about women's soccer." A working title:
- Insists on telling you something about your subject
- Shapes how you're writing about it
- Makes you articulate your angle or approach

**Examples from Germano:**
- "Compensation inequities in women's soccer" is different from "Hands off women's work"
- Either might be right, but the difference shapes every paragraph that follows

**Ask the writer**: What is this draft actually about? What's your angle? Create a working title that captures this (knowing it may change).

### Step 4: Map Natural Breaks and Sections

**Mark the natural breaks in the text**—places where something changes:

Go through the draft identifying:
- "Something happens here"
- "I'm moving to a different point in these paragraphs"
- "This section is my favorite part" (or least favorite—what matters is identifying it as a semiautonomous unit)

**Label these sections**. Give them names or labels—can be:
- Tentative and playful: "Section where I argue with Foucault"
- Serious: "The misunderstood panopticon"
- Descriptive: "Community responses to the water crisis"

You're trying on subheads for size, which is really what you're doing.

**Do this multiple times**:
1. First pass: Mark obvious divisions
2. Second pass: Do it again
3. Third pass: You'll begin to notice you're more (or less) convinced of the divisions

After several passes, you'll see:
- Shapes and misshapes emerging
- Repetitions and recursive passages
- Sentences from section G that belong in section D
- Natural units that make sense to you

### Step 5: Identify the Terrain

Analyze the mapped sections:

**Flat, easily crossed ground** (working well):
- Sections you understand clearly
- Parts that connect smoothly to what surrounds them
- Components you can manipulate effectively

**Mountainous or canyon-broken terrain** (problematic):
- Sections where you're not sure how to proceed
- Parts that don't connect well to surrounding material
- Components that feel isolated or hard to integrate
- Gaps where you need to build bridges

**Mark these different terrain types on your map**.

### Step 6: Define Borders and Scope

Help the writer articulate:

**What's inside the borders** (in scope):
- The period, geographical region, industry, community being studied
- The theoretical framework being employed
- The questions being addressed
- The material that must be included

**What's outside the borders** (out of scope):
- Related topics that won't be the focus
- Interesting tangents that would derail the project
- Supporting data that won't be directly engaged
- Future work that belongs in a different project

**Example from Germano:**
> "I am writing a study of unemployment in this period, in this geographical region, in this industry, in this socioeconomic community. The writer has just described or mapped the terrain of this analysis. The project does not intend to engage material outside this period, region, industry, or community except as supporting or comparable data. Its focus will be limited and enriched by that limitation."

By articulating borders, "you develop a clearer sense of what you will be doing."

### Step 7: Read Aloud and Track Shifts

**Read the draft out loud** and listen for:
- **Shifts**: changing emphases, new interests, emerging points of focus
- **Differences**: how the angle or approach evolves
- **Transitions**: where you move from one focus to another

**Make notes about shifts**:
- A shift isn't bad—it might be crucial, like a director changing camera angles
- When you notice a shift, stop and figure out:
  - The angle you've just created
  - The section that the angle has made
  - Label that section

**Update your map** with these observations.

### Step 8: Create the Visual Map

Based on all the analysis, create a visual representation showing:

**Spatial layout**:
```
[Title]

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Section 1: [Label]                  │
│ Pages 1-15, 3,500 words             │
│ Terrain: FLAT (working well)        │
│ Key components: X, Y, Z             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Section 2: [Label]                  │
│ Pages 16-28, 4,200 words            │
│ Terrain: MOUNTAINOUS (needs work)   │
│ Issue: unclear connection to Sec 1  │
│ Key components: A, B                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
[continue for all sections]

BORDERS:
  Inside: [what's in scope]
  Outside: [what's out of scope]
  "Here be dragons": [uncharted/risky territory]
```

### Step 9: Provide Navigation Guidance

Based on the map, help the writer see:

**Discovery, Not Repair:**
- The discovery stage of revision should be "a view from thirty-five thousand feet of the territory below"
- NOT "a moment to land and repaint the barn"
- Resist the urge to immediately rewrite underdeveloped sections

**Next Steps:**
- Which sections are working well (flat terrain)
- Which sections need development (mountainous terrain)
- Where bridges need to be built between sections
- What might need to be moved or reorganized
- What's missing within the borders
- What's present but outside the borders (and should be cut or saved for later)

**Questions for the Writer:**
- Does this map match your sense of the draft?
- Are the borders clear and appropriate?
- Which mountainous sections most need attention?
- Are there sections that should be reordered?
- Do the labels help you understand your own text?

### Step 10: Save or Present the Map

**If in Claude Code (project directory access):**
1. Ask where to save maps (suggest `maps/` or `process/maps/`)
2. Create the chosen directory if it doesn't exist
3. Save with descriptive filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-[draft-name]-map.md`
4. Include both visual map and analysis
5. Confirm the save location to the user

**If in Claude Desktop/Web (no project directory):**
1. Create the map as a formatted markdown artifact or downloadable file
2. Present it in the chat for the user to review
3. Suggest the user save it with filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-[draft-name]-map.md`
4. Offer to create alternative visualizations if requested

## Important Principles

### Spatial Thinking

Think of your prose as occupying **space**:
- Words laid out one after another create geographic territory
- Components (episodes, ideas, theories) exist in spatial relationships
- You manipulate these components by moving them through space

### Temporal Tracking

- Number pages in every draft
- Record word count
- Update at the end of each writing day
- Date each version
- This isn't obsessive—it's creating a practice of logging your spatial progress

### Intermediate Labeling

Give names to sections even if they're temporary. This:
- Announces what a section is about
- Builds your knowledge of your own text
- Helps you think about sequences as elements with obligations and capacities
- Some labels will be temporary, others may become subheads

### Multiple Passes

Map the draft multiple times:
- Divisions you create on first pass may change
- Shapes and misshapes emerge gradually
- Conviction about structure builds over iterations
- Don't worry if marked sections vary in size (some will be paragraphs, others many pages)

### Discovery Mode

The map is for **discovery**, not immediate repair:
- You're getting a view from altitude
- You'll be itching to rewrite underdeveloped islands
- Resist the itch
- Discovery stage = seeing what's there
- Repair comes later

### Fluidity and Process

- Labels that felt right may later feel out of place (move, reword, or cut them)
- Revision is about fluidity
- Focus on process, not perfection
- The map evolves as the draft evolves

*This map provides a view from altitude. You may be itching to rewrite underdeveloped sections—resist that urge for now. The discovery stage of mapping helps you see what you have so you can later figure out what's missing or what's there that shouldn't be.*
```

## Examples from Germano

### Example 1: Women's Soccer Working Titles

"I want to write about women's soccer" is too vague. A working title insists on articulating your approach:

- "Compensation inequities in women's soccer" signals one angle
- "Hands off women's work" signals a different angle

Either might be right, but the difference shapes every paragraph that follows.

### Example 2: Unemployment Study Borders

> "I am writing a study of unemployment in this period, in this geographical region, in this industry, in this socioeconomic community."

The writer has **mapped the terrain**:
- Temporal border: "this period"
- Spatial border: "this geographical region"
- Topical borders: "this industry," "this socioeconomic community"

The project will be "limited and enriched by that limitation." It won't engage material outside these borders except as supporting data.

### Example 3: Intermediate Labeling

A writer goes through a draft and marks:
- Page 17: "Community responses"
- Pages 20-25: "Community responses—the cost of bottled water, food"
- Pages 26-30: "Community responses—how does this build on the previous section? Is it really 'community' I'm talking about or particular officials from the opposition?"

The writer is:
- Identifying small islands of prose
- Labeling them (even tentatively)
- Building knowledge of their own text
- Discovering that labels might shift or need refinement

Some labeled sections occupy very little space (a couple of paragraphs), others go on for many pages. That will change, but making marks helps identify the parts.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Create organizational structures from scratch (it maps what exists)
- Automatically fix structural problems (it reveals them for the writer to address)
- Impose external organization on the material
- Replace the writer's sense of their project's direction
- Provide detailed line-editing or prose-level feedback

## Integration with Other Tools

This skill works alongside:
- **Inventory skill** (catalogues elements; map shows where they're located)
- **Keywords skill** (identifies key terms; map shows how they're distributed spatially)
- **Structural outlining tools** (used later after mapping reveals structure)
- Revision planning tools (map informs what needs revision)

## Use These Techniques Together

As Germano concludes the chapter:

> "Now make the process your own. Analyze your draft and plot your next steps. Review your archive, think through inventory, keywords, and map: use these tools separately or together, in whatever way that they can help. See where they reinforce your most important concepts and arguments. Go back and forth, checking what this one tells you and whether this other one agrees or tells you something different. Use every tool available whether you're revising a single unit (essay or chapter) or a compound one (a book manuscript composed of multiple units). Because in revising, the point is knowing what you have—really have—so that you can figure out what's missing or what's there and shouldn't be."
