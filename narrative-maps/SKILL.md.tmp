# Narrative Maps

This skill helps writers map their draft text using William Germano's spatial framework from *On Revision*. A map is a picture of what has been written so far—a way to visualize the geographic space prose occupies and to navigate the terrain from "here" to "there."

## Purpose

Just as an **inventory** catalogues elements (materials, ideas, emphases) that may or may not belong in the finished project, a **map** pictures what has been written so far. Mapping reveals spatial structure, identifies borders and scope, locates difficult terrain, and guides navigation through the text.

## When to Invoke This Skill

Invoke this skill when writers need to:
- Visualize the structure of a completed draft
- Understand component distribution across the text
- Identify which sections are working vs. problematic
- Define project borders and scope
- Navigate from current position to destination
- Track spatial progress (word counts, page numbers)
- Identify natural breaks, shifts, and transitions
- Discover repetitions, recursive passages, and misplaced elements

## Bundled Resources

**References:**
- `references/germano-framework.md` - Detailed theory, principles, and examples from Germano's framework. Read this to understand spatial thinking, borders, terrain types, and the discovery mode approach.

**Assets:**
- `assets/map-template.md` - Template for the final map output. Use this structure when creating maps.

## Task Instructions

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps to create a narrative map.

### Step 1: Detect Environment & Understand Context

**Determine the environment:**
- With access to project directory and file system tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep): Claude Code environment
- With uploaded files or chat without direct project access: Claude Desktop/Web environment

**Understand the writing context:**
1. Ask which draft or section to map
2. In Claude Code: If not specified, search for main writing files in the project
3. In Claude Desktop: Ask to share the draft text (upload file or paste text)
4. Read the draft text to understand scope and content

### Step 2: Build the Basic Map Infrastructure

**Record spatial dimensions:**
- Current word count
- Page count (actual or estimated based on ~250 words/page)
- For book-length drafts, track each chapter separately
- Date this information

Create a basic structural record:
```
Draft: [Name]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Total word count: [number]
Total pages: [number]

Structure:
- Chapter/Section 1: [word count], pages [X-Y]
- Chapter/Section 2: [word count], pages [X-Y]
```

This creates a spatial framework—the dimensions of the territory.

### Step 3: Title Everything

**Create a working title** if one doesn't exist. The real work of mapping begins with giving the draft a title.

Avoid vague descriptions like "an essay about women's soccer." A working title must:
- Tell something specific about the subject
- Shape how the subject is being approached
- Articulate the angle or approach

Examples:
- "Compensation inequities in women's soccer" vs. "Hands off women's work"
- Either might be right, but the difference shapes every paragraph

**Ask the writer**: What is this draft about? What's the angle? Create a working title that captures this (knowing it may change).

### Step 4: Map Natural Breaks and Sections

**Identify natural breaks**—places where something changes:
- "Something happens here"
- "Moving to a different point in these paragraphs"
- "This section is my favorite part" (or least favorite)

**Label these sections**:
- Can be tentative and playful: "Section where I argue with Foucault"
- Can be serious: "The misunderstood panopticon"
- Can be descriptive: "Community responses to the water crisis"

Try on subheads for size—this is what labeling accomplishes.

**Perform multiple passes**:
1. First pass: Mark obvious divisions
2. Second pass: Do it again
3. Third pass: Notice conviction strengthening or weakening about divisions

After several passes, observe:
- Shapes and misshapes emerging
- Repetitions and recursive passages
- Sentences from section G that belong in section D
- Natural units that make sense

### Step 5: Identify the Terrain

Analyze the mapped sections:

**Flat, easily crossed ground** (working well):
- Sections clearly understood
- Parts connecting smoothly to surroundings
- Components effectively manipulated

**Mountainous or canyon-broken terrain** (problematic):
- Sections where progression is unclear
- Parts not connecting well to surrounding material
- Components feeling isolated or difficult to integrate
- Gaps where bridges are needed

Mark these terrain types on the map.

### Step 6: Define Borders and Scope

Help articulate:

**Inside the borders** (in scope):
- The period, geographical region, industry, community being studied
- The theoretical framework being employed
- The questions being addressed
- The material that must be included

**Outside the borders** (out of scope):
- Related topics that won't be the focus
- Interesting tangents that would derail the project
- Supporting data that won't be directly engaged
- Future work belonging in a different project

By articulating borders, develop a clearer sense of what will be done.

**Reference**: See `references/germano-framework.md` for the unemployment study example of border definition.

### Step 7: Read Aloud and Track Shifts

**Read the draft aloud** and listen for:
- **Shifts**: changing emphases, new interests, emerging focus points
- **Differences**: how angle or approach evolves
- **Transitions**: where movement occurs from one focus to another

**Note shifts**:
- A shift isn't bad—it might be crucial, like a director changing camera angles
- When noticing a shift, stop and determine:
  - The angle just created
  - The section that the angle has made
  - Label that section

Update the map with these observations.

### Step 8: Create the Visual Map

Based on all analysis, create a visual representation. Use the template in `assets/map-template.md` as the structure.

The map should show:
- Spatial layout of all sections
- Terrain type for each section (FLAT / MOUNTAINOUS / CANYON-BROKEN)
- Word counts and page ranges
- Key components in each section
- Visual diagram showing flow and relationships
- Borders and scope (inside/outside/"here be dragons")
- Terrain analysis (what's working/what needs work)
- Shifts and transitions
- Observations (repetitions, misplaced elements, patterns)
- Navigation guidance (current position, destination, route recommendations)

### Step 9: Provide Navigation Guidance

Based on the map, help the writer see:

**Discovery, Not Repair:**
- The discovery stage of revision should be "a view from thirty-five thousand feet"
- NOT "a moment to land and repaint the barn"
- Resist the urge to immediately rewrite underdeveloped sections

**Next Steps:**
- Which sections are working well (flat terrain)
- Which sections need development (mountainous terrain)
- Where bridges need to be built between sections
- What might need to be moved or reorganized
- What's missing within the borders
- What's present but outside the borders (should be cut or saved for later)

**Questions for the Writer:**
- Does this map match the sense of the draft?
- Are the borders clear and appropriate?
- Which mountainous sections most need attention?
- Are there sections that should be reordered?
- Do the labels help understand the text?

### Step 10: Save or Present the Map

**If in Claude Code (project directory access):**
1. Ask where to save maps (suggest `maps/` or `process/maps/`)
2. Create the chosen directory if it doesn't exist
3. Save with descriptive filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-[draft-name]-map.md`
4. Include both visual map and analysis
5. Confirm the save location to the user

**If in Claude Desktop/Web (no project directory):**
1. Create the map as a formatted markdown artifact or downloadable file
2. Present it in the chat for review
3. Suggest saving it with filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-[draft-name]-map.md`
4. Offer to create alternative visualizations if requested

## Important Reminders

- **Spatial thinking**: Prose occupies space. Components exist in spatial relationships.
- **Multiple passes**: Map the draft multiple times. Conviction builds over iterations.
- **Discovery mode**: The map is for discovery, not immediate repair. View from altitude first.
- **Temporal tracking**: Number pages, record word count, date each version.
- **Fluidity**: Labels may shift. The map evolves as the draft evolves.

**Reference**: See `references/germano-framework.md` for detailed principles and examples.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Create organizational structures from scratch (it maps what exists)
- Automatically fix structural problems (it reveals them for the writer to address)
- Impose external organization on the material
- Replace the writer's sense of their project's direction
- Provide detailed line-editing or prose-level feedback

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works alongside:
- **narrative-inventory** - catalogues elements; map shows where they're located
- **narrative-keywords** - identifies key terms; map shows how they're distributed spatially
- Structural outlining tools (used later after mapping reveals structure)
- Revision planning tools (map informs what needs revision)
