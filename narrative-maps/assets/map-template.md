## Borders and Scope

### Inside the Borders (In Scope)
- [What the project includes]
- [Temporal boundaries: periods, dates]
- [Spatial boundaries: regions, locations]
- [Topical boundaries: subjects, questions]
- [Methodological boundaries: approaches, frameworks]

### Outside the Borders (Out of Scope)
- [What the project intentionally excludes]
- [Related but tangential topics]
- [Material for future projects]
- [Supporting data that won't be directly engaged]

### "Here Be Dragons" (Uncharted Territory)
- [Risky or unexplored areas within scope]
- [Sections that need exploration but feel uncertain]
- [Potential pitfalls or difficult terrain ahead]

## Terrain Analysis

### Flat, Easily Crossed (Working Well)
- [List sections that are working]
- [Why they're working]

### Mountainous or Canyon-Broken (Needs Work)
- [List problematic sections]
- [What makes them difficult]
- [Gaps or bridges needed]

## Shifts and Transitions

### Major Shifts Identified
- [Location and nature of shift 1]
- [Location and nature of shift 2]
- [etc.]

### Transition Quality
- [Where transitions work smoothly]
- [Where transitions need development]

## Observations

### Repetitions and Recursive Passages
- [Material that appears multiple times]
- [Whether repetition is intentional or should be consolidated]

### Misplaced Elements
- [Sections that might belong elsewhere]
- [Material from section X that should be in section Y]

### Emerging Patterns
- [Shapes and structures that emerged during mapping]
- [Themes or emphases that appear across sections]

## Navigation Guidance

### Current Position
[Where the draft is now—what's working, what's present]

### Destination
[Where the draft needs to go—what's missing, what needs development]

### Route Recommendations
1. [Specific next steps for revision]
2. [Sections that need expansion]
3. [Sections that need condensing]
4. [Reorganization suggestions]

### Questions for the Writer
- [Does this map reflect your intentions?]
- [Are the borders appropriate for your project?]
- [Which sections most need attention?]
- [Are there elements that should move?]

*This map provides a view from altitude. You may be itching to rewrite underdeveloped sections—resist that urge for now. The discovery stage of mapping helps you see what you have so you can later figure out what's missing or what's there that shouldn't be.*
