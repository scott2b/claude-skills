# William Germano's Keywords Framework

*From "On Revision: The Only Writing That Counts" - Chapter: "Know What You've Got" - Section: "Keywords"*

## What Keywords Are

Keywords are the powerful words and concepts central to your work. Inspired by Raymond Williams's *Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society* (1976), they are terms that carry cultural meaning and valence—the terminology that makes your discipline tick.

In your writing, keywords are:
- Concepts and words you want to carry through the entirety of your text
- Terms that do "key work" in your argument
- Ideas that readers should recognize as central to your study
- Threads that build reminders and continuities for readers

As Germano notes: "Keywords can help you to keep the energy flowing through your writing. Think electricity. At the very least, knowing where your keywords are located will tell you where the sockets are."

## Keywords Are About Distribution

The keyword exercise isn't just about identifying important terms—it's about seeing **how you've distributed your ingredients**. A keyword search reveals:
- Where powerful words occur in your text
- Whether they appear where you thought they did
- If you're saying what you hoped to say about them
- How frequency and placement support (or undermine) your argument

Distribution matters because it reveals the actual structure of your argument. It's not just about whether keywords appear, but **where** they appear and **how often**.

## Strategic Deployment

There's no rule that keywords must appear regularly throughout your text. The question is whether your deployment is **intentional**:

- Some keywords may thread throughout, creating continuity
- Others may be crucial in only one portion of the text
- If you plan to discuss a term in only one section, know why
- Take the opportunity to see what concepts you want to carry through

**Threading vs. Isolation:**
- Will the text read better if this keyword appears across chapters?
- Or would it be more effective isolated within individual chapters?
- Does current distribution match your intentions?

There's no fixed formula about how often keywords should appear. The goal is **intentional deployment** that serves your purpose.

## Important Principles

### Start with Writer's Intentions

The keyword list should begin with what the writer believes is important. The analysis then shows whether the text matches those intentions.

### Distribution Reveals Structure

Distribution isn't just about frequency—it reveals how your argument is structured. Unexpected gaps or concentrations tell you something important about what you've actually written vs. what you intended.

### Keywords Build Continuity

Readers appreciate threads built out of reminders and continuities. Strategic keyword deployment helps readers track your argument and stay oriented within complex material.

### Use Technology

Simple electronic search is powerful. Use it to call up each occurrence, see exactly where terms occur, and adjust frequency and placement based on what you discover.

### Be Willing to Adjust

If the analysis reveals that keywords don't appear where you thought, or that you're not saying what you hoped—that's valuable information for revision. Don't be defensive; be curious about what the distribution reveals.

### Context Matters

When you search for keywords, look at how they're actually used. Do the passages say what you hoped to say about these concepts? Sometimes the context reveals that a term appears frequently but isn't doing the work you thought it was.

## Examples from Germano

### Example 1: Polar Environmental Crisis

A writer summarizes their project:
> "I'm writing a history of the polar environmental crisis that considers global warming as a means of reconfiguring how we understand and measure time."

**Key terms identified**: *polar, environmental, crisis, time*

Germano's analysis: These keywords "name two enormous and very different geographic areas; *environmental* and *crisis*, which are now unfortunately inseparable, gesture toward large concepts in our modernity. Then there's *time*."

**Analysis questions**:
- How will the terms be deployed in the draft?
- Will they appear throughout, or only in two of seven chapters?
- Are these keywords threads that run throughout the work?
- Or are they concentrated in specific sections for good reasons?

The writer needs to search the draft to see if the actual distribution matches their intentions. If *time* only appears in chapters 1 and 7, is that intentional? Should it be threaded throughout to support the reconfiguration argument?

### Example 2: Evasive Behavior Study

In working notes, *depression* is a keyword, and the writer makes a strong case for its importance in chapter 1. Chapter 2 focuses on *misdirection*. Chapter 3 uses *denial* and *self-esteem* a lot.

**Analysis questions**:
- Will the text read better if you draw keywords across chapters?
- Or more successful if you isolate concepts within individual chapters?
- Should *depression* appear in chapters 2 and 3, or is its concentration in chapter 1 strategic?
- Do the chapter-specific keywords (*misdirection*, *denial*, *self-esteem*) need to be threaded earlier?

**Germano's advice**: Use the technology. Simple electronic search shows exactly where terms occur. Adjust frequency and placement based on your intentions. There's no single right answer—the question is whether the distribution serves your purpose.

### What These Examples Show

Both examples illustrate that:

1. **Keywords emerge from the writer's sense of their project** - What are you trying to say? What concepts drive your work?

2. **Distribution analysis reveals intentions vs. reality** - Where do you think keywords appear? Where do they actually appear?

3. **Strategic choices matter** - Threading creates continuity; isolation creates focus. Both can work, but the choice should be intentional.

4. **Search is a research tool** - Don't guess about distribution. Use search to see the actual pattern, then decide if it serves your goals.

## What the Keyword Exercise Helps You Do

The keyword exercise helps writers:
- Find the significant points or themes in their project
- See how concepts and words are distributed across the text
- Determine if key terms appear where they thought they did
- Assess whether they're saying what they hoped to say about important concepts
- Decide if keywords should be threaded throughout or isolated within chapters
- Track the frequency and placement of crucial terminology
- Keep energy flowing through their writing
