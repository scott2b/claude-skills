# Story Structure: Twenty-Two Steps (API)

Apply Truby's 22-step framework from *The Anatomy of Story* to analyze plot structure.

## The Twenty-Two Steps

1. **Self-revelation, need, desire (Frame)** - Endpoint + beginning
2. **Ghost and story world** - Past haunting; world expressing weakness
3. **Weakness and need** - Psychological/moral flaw
4. **Inciting event** - "Frying pan into fire"
5. **Desire** - Specific goal (start low, build)
6. **Ally or allies** - With own desire lines
7. **Opponent and/or mystery** - Must want SAME goal
8. **Fake-ally opponent**
9. **First revelation and decision** - Changed desire/motive
10. **Plan** - Hero's strategy
11. **Opponent's plan and main counterattack** - **Critical often-missing**
12. **Drive** - Development not repetition; immoral steps
13. **Attack by ally** - Confronts immorality
14. **Apparent defeat** - Only ONE
15. **Second revelation and decision** - Obsessive drive; moral decline
16. **Audience revelation** - Knows before hero
17. **Third revelation and decision** - More determined
18. **Gate, gauntlet, visit to death** - Narrow options
19. **Battle** - Values fighting; smallest space
20. **Self-revelation** - Sudden, shattering, through action
21. **Moral decision** - Choose between values
22. **New equilibrium** - Fundamental change

## Critical Principles

- **Organic plot**: Events causally connected, essential, character-driven (not author-imposed)
- **Same goal**: Opponent must want SAME goal as hero (not just oppose)
- **Step 11 crucial**: Opponent's plan most often missing - more intricate/hidden = better plot
- **Revelations sequence**: Separate from plot; logical order, build intensity, increase pace; target 7-10 for average story
- **Development not repetition**: During drive, action changes fundamentally - don't hit same beat
- **Frame technique**: Start with endpoint (self-revelation) so every step leads there
- **Seven-step foundation**: Ensure seven key steps solid before expanding to twenty-two

## Analysis Approach

**Determine story type:**
- **Forward Development**: New story - work through steps 1-22 systematically, establishing causal connections
- **Reverse Engineering**: Existing draft - identify which steps present/missing, where plot weakens/fragments
- **Plot Diagnosis**: Specific problem - identify weak/missing steps, focus on structural issue

**Length check**: Confirm story long enough for 22 steps. Short stories/sitcoms typically only hit seven major steps. Feature films/novels/hour-long TV need at least twenty-two.

**Foundation check**: Are seven key steps defined? (weakness/need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, equilibrium). If not, story may need seven-step foundation first.

## Quality Checks - Ensure Analysis Covers:

**Frame Connection:**
- Does self-revelation (endpoint) address weakness/need (beginning)?
- Is hero wrong at beginning about what they'll learn at end?

**Opponent Analysis:**
- Does opponent want SAME goal as hero?
- Is this the necessary opponent (best able to attack hero's great weakness)?
- What is hidden about the opponent (iceberg technique)?
- **Step 11**: Is opponent's plan detailed and hidden enough?

**Revelations Sequence:**
- Extract all major revelations as separate list (target: 7-10)
- Do they occur in logical order (hero would learn them)?
- Do they build in intensity (each stronger)?
- Do they increase in pace (closer together as story progresses)?
- How many about opponent? (Best kind)
- Any not explosive enough? Any breaks causing plot to stall?

**Organic Connections:**
- Desire ↔ Opponent: Same goal?
- Opponent ↔ Weakness: Necessary opponent?
- Revelations: Build logically and intensify?
- Drive: Develops vs. repeats same beat?
- Plot: Character-driven vs. author-imposed?
- Causality: All events causally connected? Each essential?

**Structural Completeness:**
- Which steps present and working well?
- Which steps missing or underdeveloped (especially middle)?
- Where does plot fragment or drag (dead middle)?
- Is opponent's plan (Step 11) intricate enough?
- Do revelations build or stall?

# 22-Step Analysis: [Story Name]

**Story Type**: [Forward Development / Reverse Engineering / Plot Diagnosis]
**Length**: [Appropriate for 22 steps? Short vs feature-length]

## FRAME (Steps 1, 3, 5, 20)

**Self-Revelation (Endpoint - Step 20)**:
- Psychological: [What hero learns about who they are]
- Moral: [What hero realizes about how they've acted toward others]

**Weakness/Need (Beginning - Step 3)**:
- Psychological weakness: [Flaw hurting hero themselves]
- Psychological need: [What must overcome]
- Moral weakness: [How hero clearly hurting others]
- Moral need: [What must overcome to stop hurting others]

**Desire (Step 5)**: [Specific goal driving hero; level: survival/revenge/win/achieve/etc.]

**Initial Error**: [What hero wrong about at beginning - cannot learn at end unless wrong at beginning]

## STEPS 2-22

**Step 2 - Ghost/Story World**:
- Ghost: [Past event haunting hero; open wound; counterdesire]
- Story world: [Arena, settings; how expresses hero's weakness]
- Opening type: [Community start / Running start / Slow start]

**Step 4 - Inciting Event**: [External event causing goal; "frying pan into fire" - hero thinks solves problem but gets into worst trouble]

**Step 6 - Allies**: [Who helps; their desire lines; how define hero through comparison]

**Step 7 - Opponent**:
- Who: [Character/entity]
- **Opponent's goal**: [Must be SAME goal as hero]
- Values: [How differ from hero's]
- Why necessary: [Best able to attack hero's great weakness]
- What's hidden: [Iceberg opponent hierarchy if applicable]

**Step 8 - Fake-Ally Opponent**: [Who; appears to help but actually opponent; true allegiance]

**Step 9 - First Revelation & Decision**:
- Revelation: [Explosive new info, preferably about opponent]
- Decision: [What hero decides]
- Changed desire: [How goal bends not breaks]
- Changed motive: [Why want it now]

**Step 10 - Plan**: [Hero's strategy to overcome opponent; why will initial plan fail]

**Step 11 - Opponent's Plan & Counterattack**:
- Opponent's strategy: [Detailed]
- Hidden attacks: [List specific attacks opponent has devised]
- Main counterattack: [How sprung on hero as revelation]
- **Note**: More intricate and hidden = better plot

**Step 12 - Drive**: [Series of actions hero performs; ensure development not repetition; immoral steps hero begins taking]

**Step 13 - Attack by Ally**: [How ally confronts hero's immoral actions; hero's justification]

**Step 14 - Apparent Defeat**: [What happens 2/3-3/4 through; why feels devastating; only ONE defeat]

**Step 15 - Second Revelation & Decision**:
- Revelation: [New info showing victory still possible]
- Obsessive drive: [Hero becomes tyrannical]
- Changed desire: [Goal intensifies]
- Moral decline: [Continued immoral actions]

**Step 16 - Audience Revelation**: [What audience learns hero doesn't know; shows true power of opposition; often fake-ally reveal]

**Step 17 - Third Revelation & Decision**: [Hero discovers (often fake-ally truth); becomes more determined]

**Step 18 - Gate/Gauntlet/Visit to Death**: [Conflict intensifies, options narrow; mortality realization spurs fight]

**Step 19 - Battle**:
- Final confrontation: [Where/when; smallest space possible]
- **Values fighting**: [What two sides fighting for - not just who stronger]
- Who wins goal: [Outcome]
- How hero like opponent yet different: [Crucial differences clearer in similarity]
- Theme explosion: [How theme first explodes in audience's mind]

**Step 21 - Moral Decision**:
- Two courses of action: [Choices]
- Values each represents: [What each stands for]
- Hero's choice: [What chosen]
- Proves self-revelation: [How demonstrates what learned]

**Step 22 - New Equilibrium**: [What fundamentally changed; higher or lower level; lasting impact]

## REVELATIONS SEQUENCE

**Total count**: [Number - industry standard: 7-10 for hit films]

| # | Revelation | Source | About Opponent? | Intensity (1-10) | Builds from previous? |
|---|------------|--------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | [What learned] | [How/from whom] | [Yes/No] | [#] | N/A |
| 2 | [What learned] | [How/from whom] | [Yes/No] | [#] | [Yes/No - explain] |
| 3 | [What learned] | [How/from whom] | [Yes/No] | [#] | [Yes/No - explain] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Sequence Assessment**:
- Logical order (hero would learn them): [Yes/No/Mostly - explain]
- Build in intensity: [Yes/No/Mostly - explain; note any drops]
- Increasing pace (closer together): [Yes/No/Mostly - explain]
- Reversals: [Any reversals where understanding changes instantly?]

## ORGANIC CONNECTIONS
