# Story Structure: Seven Key Steps

This skill helps writers analyze and develop story structure using John Truby's seven-step framework from *The Anatomy of Story*. These steps represent the organic DNA of story—the sequence any human being must work through to solve a life problem.

## Purpose

Truby's seven steps are based on **human action**—the natural process of how people address problems in life. They help you:
- Create stories with organic, internally generated structure
- Ensure your hero undergoes meaningful character change
- Build dramatic conflict through competing desires
- Link all story elements to your premise line
- Avoid mechanical plot formulas in favor of character-driven development
- Achieve the greatest emotional impact on your audience

As Truby emphasizes: "The seven steps are not arbitrarily imposed from without, the way a mechanical story structure such as three-act structure is. They exist *in* the story. These seven steps are the nucleus, the DNA, of your story."

## When to Invoke This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Developing a new story idea and need to find its structural foundation
- Your story feels reactive or lacks clear dramatic drive
- Characters aren't changing or growing meaningfully
- The opponent/antagonist feels generic or unclear
- You're unsure what your story is really about
- Scenes exist but don't build toward a unified endpoint
- You want to deepen psychological and moral dimensions
- You need to identify what's missing in your structure

## The Seven Key Steps (from Truby)

### 1. Weakness and Need
**The hero has a great weakness holding them back**, something so profound it's ruining their life.

**The need** is what the hero must fulfill within themselves to have a better life. It involves overcoming weaknesses and changing/growing in some way.

**Key principle**: The hero should NOT be aware of their need at the beginning. They become aware only at the self-revelation, near the end, after great pain (drama) or struggle (comedy).

**Two forms of need:**
- **Psychological need**: Overcoming a flaw that hurts the hero themselves
- **Moral need**: Overcoming a flaw that hurts *other people*

Better stories include both. A character with a moral need is always hurting others at the beginning of the story.

**Techniques for creating moral need:**
1. Begin with psychological weakness → figure out what immoral action might come from it → identify the deep-seated moral weakness and need that are the source
2. Push a strength so far it becomes a weakness → identify a virtue in your character → make them so passionate about it that it becomes oppressive → find the negative version of that value

### 2. Desire
**What the hero wants in this story**—their particular goal.

Desire is the **visible, external goal** that drives the plot forward. It's what the audience "rides along" with—the train everyone gets on together.

**Crucial distinction:**
- **Need**: Internal, hidden, about overcoming weakness *within* the character (buried under the surface)
- **Desire**: External, visible, about reaching a goal *outside* the character (on the surface—what audience *thinks* story is about)

When the hero accomplishes their goal, they usually also fulfill their need.

**Key principle**: Your hero's true desire is what they want *in this story*, not what they want *in life*. The desire must be specific to this narrative and require a series of actions to achieve.

**Warning**: Don't confuse need and desire or think of them as a single step. They form the beginning of your story but are two unique story steps with different functions.

### 3. Opponent
**The character competing with the hero for the same goal**.

The opponent is NOT just "the bad guy." A true opponent:
- Wants to prevent the hero from achieving their desire
- Is **competing with the hero for the same goal**
- Attacks the hero's greatest weakness

**Key principle**: The opponent must want the SAME goal as the hero. Only by competing for the same goal are hero and opponent forced into direct conflict again and again. If they have separate goals, there's no story.

**Finding the deepest conflict**: Hero and opponent often appear to fight about one thing (surface goal) but are really fighting about something deeper—usually **which version of reality everyone will believe**.

**Common mistake**: Making the opponent purely evil. When a character has no moral flaws, the opponent dominates and the story becomes reactive and predictable. Both hero and opponent need complexity.

### 4. Plan
**The set of guidelines or strategies the hero will use to overcome the opponent and reach the goal**.

Action isn't possible without some plan. The plan should be:
- Specifically focused toward defeating the opponent and reaching the goal
- Complex enough to involve multiple steps
- Flexible—the hero must adjust when the initial plan doesn't work

The plan is organically linked to both desire and opponent. It shapes the rest of the story and determines what actions unfold.

### 5. Battle
**The final conflict between hero and opponent** that determines which character wins the goal.

Throughout the middle of the story, hero and opponent engage in punch-counterpunch confrontation as each tries to win. The conflict heats up. The battle is this **final** conflict—the climactic confrontation.

The battle may be:
- A conflict of violence (physical confrontation)
- A conflict of words (verbal showdown)

Whatever form it takes, it should be intense and put the hero to the ultimate test.

### 6. Self-Revelation
**The hero has a major revelation about who they really is**.

The battle is an intense and painful experience for the hero. This crucible causes the hero to see themselves honestly for the first time, stripping away the facade they've lived behind.

**Two forms (matching the two forms of need):**
- **Psychological self-revelation**: Hero sees themselves in a new light, understands their flaw
- **Moral self-revelation**: Hero realizes they've been wrong, hurt others, and must change; they prove the change by taking new moral action

**Key principle**: Don't have your hero come right out and say what they learned. This is obvious and preachy. Instead, **suggest the insight by the actions the hero takes** leading up to the self-revelation.

**Quality marker**: Much of the quality of your story is based on the quality of this self-revelation.

**Critical connection**: Self-revelation is most closely connected to need. These two steps communicate the character change of your hero:
- Need = mark of hero's immaturity at the beginning
- Self-revelation = endpoint of that change; what hero learns/gains that allows better life in future

### 7. New Equilibrium
**Everything returns to normal, and all desire is gone**—except there is now one major difference.

The hero has moved to a higher or lower level as a result of going through their crucible. A fundamental and permanent change has occurred.

**Positive self-revelation**: Hero realizes who they truly are and learns how to live properly in the world—moves to higher level.

**Negative self-revelation**: Hero learns they've committed a terrible crime expressing a corrupt personal flaw OR is incapable of having a self-revelation—falls or is destroyed.

The new equilibrium shows the lasting impact of the hero's journey.

## Task Instructions

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Detect Environment & Understand Context

**First, determine your environment:**
- If you have access to a project directory and file system tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep): You are in **Claude Code**
- If the user uploaded files or you're working in a chat without direct project access: You are in **Claude Desktop/Web**

**Then understand the story context:**
1. Ask the user which story they want to analyze or develop
2. In Claude Code: If not specified, search for story files in the project (narrative drafts, outlines, character notes)
3. In Claude Desktop: Ask the user to describe their story or share existing materials
4. Understand whether this is:
   - A new story idea needing structure
   - An existing draft needing structural analysis
   - A story in development with some elements defined

### Step 2: Determine Analysis Approach

Based on what the writer has, choose the appropriate approach:

**A. Forward Development (New Story)**
If the writer has only a basic idea or concept:
1. Start by working on the **self-revelation** (Step 6)—determine the endpoint first
2. Then work backward to figure out **need** (Step 1) and **desire** (Step 2)
3. Build the rest of the structure from this foundation

**B. Reverse Engineering (Existing Draft)**
If the writer has a draft or substantial material:
1. Read/analyze the existing story material
2. Identify which of the seven steps are present (explicitly or implicitly)
3. Assess which steps are missing or underdeveloped
4. Show how existing elements map to the seven-step structure

**C. Problem Diagnosis (Stuck Story)**
If the writer knows something isn't working:
1. Identify which step(s) are weak or missing
2. Focus on the specific structural problem
3. Use the seven steps to diagnose and solve the issue

**Ask the writer which approach best fits their situation.**

### Step 3: Build the Seven-Step Structure

Work through each step systematically. For each step:

#### Step 1: Weakness and Need

**Questions to explore:**
- What great weakness is holding your hero back at the beginning?
- What is missing within them that is so profound it's ruining their life?
- What must they overcome/change to have a better life?

**Develop both forms:**
- **Psychological weakness**: What flaw hurts the hero themselves?
- **Psychological need**: What must they overcome internally?
- **Moral weakness**: How is the hero hurting *others* at the beginning?
- **Moral need**: What must they learn about how to act properly toward other people?

**Technique application:**
- If psychological need comes first, figure out what immoral action might come from that weakness
- Or: identify a virtue and push it so far it becomes oppressive, then find its negative version

**Key reminder**: The hero should NOT be aware of this need at the beginning.

#### Step 2: Desire

**Questions to explore:**
- What does your hero want *in this story* (not in life generally)?
- What specific goal are they pursuing?
- What actions will this goal require them to take?

**Distinction check:**
- Is this goal external and visible (desire) or internal and hidden (need)?
- Does pursuing this goal create forward momentum in the story?
- Will accomplishing this goal also fulfill the hero's need?

**Warning check**: Make sure desire and need are distinct. Desire is on the surface (what audience thinks story is about). Need is hidden beneath (what story is really about).

#### Step 3: Opponent

**Questions to explore:**
- Who wants to prevent your hero from achieving their desire?
- **What goal does the opponent want?** (Must be the SAME goal as hero)
- How does the opponent attack the hero's greatest weakness?
- What makes this opponent particularly good at defeating this particular hero?

**Deepest conflict question**: What is the most important thing the hero and opponent are fighting about? (Often: which version of reality will everyone believe)

**Complexity check:**
- Does your opponent have moral complexity (not pure evil)?
- Does the opponent have their own psychological need?
- Why does the opponent believe they're right?

**If opponent feels generic**: Go back to the question "What is the deepest conflict they're fighting about?" and ensure both want the same goal.

#### Step 4: Plan

**Questions to explore:**
- What strategy will your hero use to overcome the opponent and reach the goal?
- Is the plan specific and focused on defeating this particular opponent?
- Is the plan complex enough to involve multiple steps/actions?
- What happens when the plan doesn't work? How must it adapt?

**Structure check**: The plan should shape the middle of your story. If it's too simple, your story will be too short.

#### Step 5: Battle

**Questions to explore:**
- What is the final confrontation between hero and opponent?
- Where/when does this climactic conflict occur?
- Is it a battle of violence or a battle of words (or both)?
- How does this battle put the hero to the ultimate test?
- Who wins the goal?

**Intensity check**: Make sure the battle is intense enough to force the hero's self-revelation.

#### Step 6: Self-Revelation

**Questions to explore:**
- After the intense battle, what does the hero realize about who they really are?
- How do they see themselves honestly for the first time?
- What facade have they been living behind that now strips away?

**Two forms (match to the needs identified in Step 1):**
- **Psychological**: How does hero see themselves in a new light?
- **Moral**: How does hero realize they've been wrong and hurt others? What new moral action proves they've changed?

**Quality assessment:**
- Is this revelation specific and meaningful?
- Does it emerge from the hero's actions rather than being stated directly?
- Is it profound enough to justify the entire story?

**Critical link**: Does this self-revelation directly address the need identified in Step 1?

#### Step 7: New Equilibrium

**Questions to explore:**
- How has the hero changed fundamentally and permanently?
- Have they moved to a higher level (positive revelation) or lower level/destruction (negative revelation)?
- What does the world look like now that the hero has changed?
- How is this different from the beginning?

**Closure check**: All desire should be gone. The goal has been won or lost. A fundamental change has occurred.

### Step 4: Assess Organic Connections

Once all seven steps are identified/developed, assess how they link together:

**Connection 1: Need → Desire**
- Does the hero's external desire (Step 2) ultimately lead to fulfilling their internal need (Step 1)?
- Are these two steps organically connected or arbitrary?

**Connection 2: Desire → Opponent**
- Does the opponent want the SAME goal as the hero's desire?
- Will they come into direct conflict repeatedly?

**Connection 3: Opponent → Plan**
- Is the plan specifically designed to defeat this particular opponent?
- Does it account for the opponent's strengths?

**Connection 4: Desire + Opponent → Plan**
- Does the plan aim at both defeating opponent AND reaching the goal?

**Connection 5: Plan → Battle**
- Does the plan (and its adjustments) lead organically to the final battle?

**Connection 6: Battle → Self-Revelation**
- Is the battle intense enough to force the hero to see themselves honestly?
- Does the crucible of battle cause the self-revelation?

**Connection 7: Need → Self-Revelation**
- Does the self-revelation directly address the need from Step 1?
- Are these the beginning and endpoint of character change?

**If connections are weak**: The seven steps may be present but not organically linked. Help the writer strengthen the connections by revising steps to better imply/require each other.

### Step 5: Identify What's Missing or Weak

Based on the analysis, identify:

**Missing steps:**
- Which of the seven steps are absent from the story?
- What impact does each absence have on the structure?

**Underdeveloped steps:**
- Which steps are present but too weak or generic?
- How could they be deepened or made more specific?

**Disconnected steps:**
- Which steps don't organically connect to surrounding steps?
- How could connections be strengthened?

**Common problems to check for:**
- Hero aware of their need at the beginning (should be unaware until self-revelation)
- Need and desire confused or treated as one thing
- Opponent wants different goal than hero (no direct conflict)
- Opponent is purely evil (no moral complexity)
- Self-revelation stated directly rather than shown through actions
- No clear character change from beginning to end

### Step 6: Provide Development Recommendations

Based on the assessment, provide specific, actionable recommendations:

**For missing steps:**
- "Your story lacks a clear self-revelation. Consider: what does your hero learn about themselves after the battle? This should connect directly to the need you've identified."

**For weak steps:**
- "Your opponent feels generic because they want a different goal than your hero. What if they both wanted [specific shared goal]? This would force them into repeated direct conflict."

**For disconnected steps:**
- "The plan doesn't seem designed to defeat this particular opponent. What if the hero's strategy specifically exploited/addressed [opponent's characteristic]?"

**For structural problems:**
- "Your hero seems aware of their need from the start, which removes the possibility of meaningful revelation. What if they believed [opposite thing] at the beginning?"

### Step 7: Create Visual Structure Map

Create a visual representation showing:

```markdown
## Seven-Step Structure: [Story Title]

### 1. WEAKNESS AND NEED
**Psychological Weakness**: [description]
**Psychological Need**: [what must be overcome]
**Moral Weakness**: [how hero hurts others]
**Moral Need**: [what must be learned]
**Hero's awareness**: Unaware / Partially aware / Fully aware (should be unaware)

### 2. DESIRE
**Goal in this story**: [specific external desire]
**Why this goal**: [what drives hero toward it]
**Connection to need**: [how achieving desire might fulfill need]

### 3. OPPONENT
**Who**: [opponent identity]
**Their goal**: [must be SAME as hero's goal]
**Why they're dangerous**: [how they attack hero's weakness]
**Moral complexity**: [opponent's own needs/justifications]
**Deepest conflict**: [what they're really fighting about]

### 4. PLAN
**Hero's strategy**: [how they'll defeat opponent and reach goal]
**Complexity**: [multiple steps/adjustments required]
**Adaptation**: [how plan must change when it fails]

### 5. BATTLE

### 7. NEW EQUILIBRIUM
**Change**: [how hero has fundamentally changed]
**Level**: Higher / Lower / Destroyed
**New world**: [what life looks like now]
**Permanence**: [why this change is lasting]

## Organic Connections Assessment

**Need → Desire**: [How well connected?]
**Desire → Opponent**: [Competing for same goal?]
**Opponent → Plan**: [Plan designed for this opponent?]
**Battle → Self-Revelation**: [Battle intense enough to force revelation?]
**Need → Self-Revelation**: [Endpoint addresses beginning?]

## What's Working

[List strong structural elements]

## What Needs Development

[List missing or weak elements with specific recommendations]
```

### Step 8: Save or Present the Analysis

**If in Claude Code (project directory access):**
1. Ask where to save structure analyses (suggest `structure/` or `process/structure/`)
2. Create the chosen directory if it doesn't exist
3. Save with descriptive filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-7-steps.md`
4. Include both the step-by-step breakdown and recommendations
5. Confirm the save location to the user

**If in Claude Desktop/Web (no project directory):**
1. Create the analysis as a formatted markdown artifact or downloadable file
2. Present it in the chat for the user to review
3. Suggest the user save it with filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-7-steps.md`
4. Offer to explore any specific step in more depth if requested

## Important Principles

### Start at the End

Truby recommends: **Determine the self-revelation first, then work backward** to figure out need and desire. This ensures the entire story heads toward the true endpoint of the structural journey.

### Organic, Not Mechanical

The seven steps are NOT a formula imposed from outside (like three-act structure). They exist IN the story because they're based on human action—how people solve problems in life.

### Character Change is Central

The seven steps communicate character change:
- **Need** (Step 1) = beginning of character change
- **Self-revelation** (Step 6) = endpoint of character change
- Everything between shows the journey from immaturity to growth (or destruction)

### Both Psychological AND Moral

Average stories only give heroes psychological needs. Better stories include moral needs—the hero must learn how to act properly toward others, not just overcome personal flaws.

### Weakness and Need are the Foundation

These are "the wellspring of the story and set up every other step." If you skip this first step:
- You kill the payoff (the ending)
- Story becomes reactive instead of organic
- Character change becomes impossible
- Audience won't care

As Truby warns: "Don't skip that first step. Ever."

### Desire is NOT Need

One of the biggest mistakes: confusing need and desire or thinking of them as single step. They're two unique steps with different functions that form the beginning of your story.

### The Opponent Must Want the Same Goal

If hero and opponent have separate goals, they won't come into direct conflict, and "you have no story at all." The opponent competing for the same goal is what creates repeated confrontation.

### Self-Revelation Through Action, Not Statement

Don't have the hero explicitly say what they learned. This is "obvious and preachy and will turn off your audience." Suggest insight through the hero's actions.

### Quality = Quality of Self-Revelation

"Much of the quality of your story is based on the quality of this self-revelation." This is where you show whether your story has genuine depth or is superficial.

## Examples from Truby

### The Godfather

**Weaknesses**: Michael is young, inexperienced, untested, overconfident
**Psychological Need**: Overcome sense of superiority and self-righteousness
**Moral Need**: Avoid becoming ruthless like other Mafia bosses while protecting family
**Problem**: Rival gang members shoot Michael's father, head of the family
**Desire**: Take revenge on the men who shot his father and protect his family
**Opponent**: Barzini (hidden power behind Sollozzo), who wants to bring entire Corleone family down. Michael and Barzini compete over survival of the Corleone family and who will control crime in New York.
**Plan**: (1) Kill Sollozzo and police captain; (2) Kill heads of other families in single strike
**Battle**: Crosscut between Michael's appearance at nephew's baptism and killing of five Mafia family heads. At baptism, Michael renounces Satan while his gunmen execute his enemies.
**Psychological Self-Revelation**: None. Michael still believes his superiority and self-righteousness is justified.
**Moral Self-Revelation**: None. Michael has become a ruthless killer. The writers use advanced technique: give moral self-revelation to hero's wife Kay, who sees what he's become as door slams in her face.
**New Equilibrium**: Michael has killed enemies and "risen" to position of Godfather. But morally, he has fallen and become "the devil." He will kill anyone who betrays him or gets in his way.

### Chinatown

**Need**: Jake must overcome cocky arrogance, learn to trust others (psychological). Must stop using people for money and bring a murderer to justice (moral).
**Desire**: Solve the mystery—find out who killed Hollis and why.
**Opponent**: Noah Cross wants to control future of Los Angeles with water scheme. But because *Chinatown* is detective story, Jake and Cross actually compete over **whose version of the truth will be believed**. Cross wants everyone to believe Hollis drowned accidentally and Evelyn's daughter is his granddaughter. Jake wants everyone to believe Cross killed Hollis and raped his own daughter.
**Plan**: Question those who knew Hollis and track the physical evidence connected to his murder.
**Battle**: A cop kills Evelyn, and Noah gets away with Evelyn's daughter while Jake walks off in despair.
**Self-Revelation**: Negative. After Evelyn's death, Jake mumbles "As little as possible." He believes his life is not only useless but destructive. Once again, he has hurt someone he loves.

### Saving Private Ryan

**Need**: Hero John Miller must do his duty in spite of his fear (psychological and moral)
**Desire**: Find Private Ryan and bring him back alive

### The Verdict

**Need**: Hero must regain self-respect (psychological) and learn to act with justice toward others (moral)
**Desire**: Win the case (courtroom drama)

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Replace the writer's creative vision or storytelling instincts
- Guarantee a "good" story (execution still matters)
- Work for all story types (particularly suited for character-driven drama)
- Provide scene-by-scene plotting (it establishes structural foundation)
- Eliminate the need for other story elements (theme, world-building, etc.)

## Integration with Other Tools

This skill works alongside:
- **Narrative inventory** (Germano): Catalogues what you have; seven steps shows if structure is present
- **Narrative keywords** (Germano): Identifies conceptual threads; seven steps ensures they build toward self-revelation
- **Narrative maps** (Germano): Shows spatial structure; seven steps shows dramatic structure
- **Character development tools**: Seven steps provides framework for character arc
- **Scene planning tools**: Seven steps establishes what scenes must accomplish

## When Seven Steps May Not Apply

Truby's framework is particularly powerful for:
- Character-driven drama
- Stories focused on personal transformation
- Narratives with clear protagonist-antagonist relationships
- Traditional story forms (novels, screenplays, short stories with conventional structure)

It may be less applicable for:
- Highly experimental or non-linear narratives
- Stories without clear protagonists
- Ensemble pieces without a single hero's journey
- Plotless or avant-garde fiction
- Fragmented/collage narratives (like *Brother's Keeper*)

**However**: Even experimental narratives can benefit from understanding the seven steps, either to consciously work with them or deliberately subvert them.

## Using Seven Steps with Non-Traditional Narratives

For fragmented or experimental stories:

**Option 1: Hidden Structure**
The seven steps may exist beneath the surface even if chronology is scrambled. Identify them in narrative time (when events happen) vs. discourse time (when reader encounters them).

**Option 2: Multiple Journeys**
If you have multiple protagonists, each may have their own seven-step structure that intersect.

**Option 3: Truncated or Inverted**
You might deliberately truncate the structure (no self-revelation, no new equilibrium) or invert it (self-revelation comes early, creating different effects).

**Option 4: Use as Diagnostic**
Even if you're not following seven steps, understanding them helps you see what's missing—which you can then deliberately omit or unconventionally arrange.
