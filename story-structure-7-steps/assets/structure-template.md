## The Seven Steps

### Step 1: Weakness and Need

**Psychological Weakness**: [What flaw hurts the hero themselves?]

**Psychological Need**: [What must they overcome internally?]

**Moral Weakness**: [How is the hero hurting others at the beginning?]

**Moral Need**: [What must they learn about how to act properly toward others?]

**Current status**: [Present / Missing / Underdeveloped]

**Notes**: [Observations about this step in the story]

### Step 2: Desire

**Hero's Goal**: [What does the hero want in this story?]

**Specific Actions Required**: [What must hero do to achieve this goal?]

**Distinction from Need**: [How is this external goal different from internal need?]

**Current status**: [Present / Missing / Underdeveloped]

**Notes**: [Observations about this step in the story]

### Step 3: Opponent

**Who**: [Character competing with hero]

**Opponent's Goal**: [Must be SAME goal as hero - what is it?]

**How Opponent Attacks Weakness**: [How does opponent target hero's greatest weakness?]

**Deepest Conflict**: [What are they really fighting about? Whose version of reality will be believed?]

**Opponent's Complexity**: [Moral complexity, their own need, why they believe they're right]

**Current status**: [Present / Missing / Underdeveloped]

**Notes**: [Observations about this step in the story]

### Step 4: Plan

**Hero's Strategy**: [What guidelines/strategies will hero use to overcome opponent?]

**Complexity**: [Is it complex enough? Multiple steps?]

**Adaptation**: [How must plan adapt when it doesn't work?]

**Connection to Desire and Opponent**: [How organically does plan emerge from these steps?]

**Current status**: [Present / Missing / Underdeveloped]

**Notes**: [Observations about this step in the story]

### Step 5: Battle

**Final Confrontation**: [Describe the climactic conflict]

**Type**: [Violence / Words / Both]

**Location/Timing**: [Where and when does this occur?]

**Intensity**: [Is it intense enough to force self-revelation?]

**Who Wins**: [Which character achieves the goal?]

**Current status**: [Present / Missing / Underdeveloped]

**Notes**: [Observations about this step in the story]

### Step 6: Self-Revelation

**Psychological Self-Revelation**: [What does hero understand about their flaw?]

**Moral Self-Revelation**: [What does hero realize about how they've hurt others?]

**Shown Through Action**: [How is insight suggested through actions, not stated directly?]

**Quality**: [Does this revelation have depth or is it superficial?]

**Connection to Need**: [How does this revelation address the need from Step 1?]

**Current status**: [Present / Missing / Underdeveloped]

**Notes**: [Observations about this step in the story]

### Step 7: New Equilibrium

**What Has Changed**: [What is fundamentally different now?]

**Hero's Level**: [Has hero moved to higher or lower level?]

**Positive or Negative**: [Did hero grow or fall/be destroyed?]

**Lasting Impact**: [How permanent is this change?]

**Current status**: [Present / Missing / Underdeveloped]

**Notes**: [Observations about this step in the story]
