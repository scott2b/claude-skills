# John Truby's Seven Key Steps Framework

*From "The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller" - Chapter: "The Seven Key Steps of Story Structure"*

## What Are the Seven Steps?

The seven steps represent the organic DNA of story—the sequence any human being must work through to solve a life problem. They are based on **human action**, not arbitrary plot formulas.

As Truby emphasizes: "The seven steps are not arbitrarily imposed from without, the way a mechanical story structure such as three-act structure is. They exist *in* the story. These seven steps are the nucleus, the DNA, of your story."

The seven steps help writers:
- Create stories with organic, internally generated structure
- Ensure heroes undergo meaningful character change
- Build dramatic conflict through competing desires
- Link all story elements to the premise line
- Avoid mechanical plot formulas in favor of character-driven development
- Achieve the greatest emotional impact on the audience

## The Seven Key Steps

### 1. Weakness and Need

**The hero has a great weakness holding them back**, something so profound it's ruining their life.

**The need** is what the hero must fulfill within themselves to have a better life. It involves overcoming weaknesses and changing/growing in some way.

**Key principle**: The hero should NOT be aware of their need at the beginning. They become aware only at the self-revelation, near the end, after great pain (drama) or struggle (comedy).

**Two forms of need:**
- **Psychological need**: Overcoming a flaw that hurts the hero themselves
- **Moral need**: Overcoming a flaw that hurts *other people*

Better stories include both. A character with a moral need is always hurting others at the beginning of the story.

**Techniques for creating moral need:**
1. Begin with psychological weakness → figure out what immoral action might come from it → identify the deep-seated moral weakness and need that are the source
2. Push a strength so far it becomes a weakness → identify a virtue in the character → make them so passionate about it that it becomes oppressive → find the negative version of that value

### 2. Desire

**What the hero wants in this story**—their particular goal.

Desire is the **visible, external goal** that drives the plot forward. It's what the audience "rides along" with—the train everyone gets on together.

**Crucial distinction:**
- **Need**: Internal, hidden, about overcoming weakness *within* the character (buried under the surface)
- **Desire**: External, visible, about reaching a goal *outside* the character (on the surface—what audience *thinks* story is about)

When the hero accomplishes their goal, they usually also fulfill their need.

**Key principle**: The hero's true desire is what they want *in this story*, not what they want *in life*. The desire must be specific to this narrative and require a series of actions to achieve.

**Warning**: Don't confuse need and desire or think of them as a single step. They form the beginning of the story but are two unique story steps with different functions.

### 3. Opponent

**The character competing with the hero for the same goal**.

The opponent is NOT just "the bad guy." A true opponent:
- Wants to prevent the hero from achieving their desire
- Is **competing with the hero for the same goal**
- Attacks the hero's greatest weakness

**Key principle**: The opponent must want the SAME goal as the hero. Only by competing for the same goal are hero and opponent forced into direct conflict again and again. If they have separate goals, there's no story.

**Finding the deepest conflict**: Hero and opponent often appear to fight about one thing (surface goal) but are really fighting about something deeper—usually **which version of reality everyone will believe**.

**Common mistake**: Making the opponent purely evil. When a character has no moral flaws, the opponent dominates and the story becomes reactive and predictable. Both hero and opponent need complexity.

### 4. Plan

**The set of guidelines or strategies the hero will use to overcome the opponent and reach the goal**.

Action isn't possible without some plan. The plan should be:
- Specifically focused toward defeating the opponent and reaching the goal
- Complex enough to involve multiple steps
- Flexible—the hero must adjust when the initial plan doesn't work

The plan is organically linked to both desire and opponent. It shapes the rest of the story and determines what actions unfold.

### 5. Battle

**The final conflict between hero and opponent** that determines which character wins the goal.

Throughout the middle of the story, hero and opponent engage in punch-counterpunch confrontation as each tries to win. The conflict heats up. The battle is this **final** conflict—the climactic confrontation.

The battle may be:
- A conflict of violence (physical confrontation)
- A conflict of words (verbal showdown)

Whatever form it takes, it should be intense and put the hero to the ultimate test.

### 6. Self-Revelation

**The hero has a major revelation about who they really are**.

The battle is an intense and painful experience for the hero. This crucible causes the hero to see themselves honestly for the first time, stripping away the facade they've lived behind.

**Two forms (matching the two forms of need):**
- **Psychological self-revelation**: Hero sees themselves in a new light, understands their flaw
- **Moral self-revelation**: Hero realizes they've been wrong, hurt others, and must change; they prove the change by taking new moral action

**Key principle**: Don't have the hero come right out and say what they learned. This is obvious and preachy. Instead, **suggest the insight by the actions the hero takes** leading up to the self-revelation.

**Quality marker**: Much of the quality of the story is based on the quality of this self-revelation.

**Critical connection**: Self-revelation is most closely connected to need. These two steps communicate the character change:
- Need = mark of hero's immaturity at the beginning
- Self-revelation = endpoint of that change; what hero learns/gains that allows better life in future

### 7. New Equilibrium

**Everything returns to normal, and all desire is gone**—except there is now one major difference.

The hero has moved to a higher or lower level as a result of going through their crucible. A fundamental and permanent change has occurred.

**Positive self-revelation**: Hero realizes who they truly are and learns how to live properly in the world—moves to higher level.

**Negative self-revelation**: Hero learns they've committed a terrible crime expressing a corrupt personal flaw OR is incapable of having a self-revelation—falls or is destroyed.

The new equilibrium shows the lasting impact of the hero's journey.

## Important Principles

### Start at the End

Truby recommends: **Determine the self-revelation first, then work backward** to figure out need and desire. This ensures the entire story heads toward the true endpoint of the structural journey.

### Organic, Not Mechanical

The seven steps are NOT a formula imposed from outside (like three-act structure). They exist IN the story because they're based on human action—how people solve problems in life.

### Character Change is Central

The seven steps communicate character change:
- **Need** (Step 1) = beginning of character change
- **Self-revelation** (Step 6) = endpoint of character change
- Everything between shows the journey from immaturity to growth (or destruction)

### Both Psychological AND Moral

Average stories only give heroes psychological needs. Better stories include moral needs—the hero must learn how to act properly toward others, not just overcome personal flaws.

### Weakness and Need are the Foundation

These are "the wellspring of the story and set up every other step." If this first step is skipped:
- The payoff (the ending) is killed
- Story becomes reactive instead of organic
- Character change becomes impossible
- Audience won't care

As Truby warns: "Don't skip that first step. Ever."

### Desire is NOT Need

One of the biggest mistakes: confusing need and desire or thinking of them as single step. They're two unique steps with different functions that form the beginning of the story.

### The Opponent Must Want the Same Goal

If hero and opponent have separate goals, they won't come into direct conflict, and "you have no story at all." The opponent competing for the same goal is what creates repeated confrontation.

### Self-Revelation Through Action, Not Statement

Don't have the hero explicitly say what they learned. This is "obvious and preachy and will turn off your audience." Suggest insight through the hero's actions.

### Quality = Quality of Self-Revelation

"Much of the quality of your story is based on the quality of this self-revelation." This is where the story's genuine depth or superficiality is revealed.

## Examples from Truby

### The Godfather

**Weaknesses**: Michael is young, inexperienced, untested, overconfident
**Psychological Need**: Overcome sense of superiority and self-righteousness
**Moral Need**: Avoid becoming ruthless like other Mafia bosses while protecting family
**Problem**: Rival gang members shoot Michael's father, head of the family
**Desire**: Take revenge on the men who shot his father and protect his family
**Opponent**: Barzini (hidden power behind Sollozzo), who wants to bring entire Corleone family down. Michael and Barzini compete over survival of the Corleone family and who will control crime in New York.
**Plan**: (1) Kill Sollozzo and police captain; (2) Kill heads of other families in single strike
**Battle**: Crosscut between Michael's appearance at nephew's baptism and killing of five Mafia family heads. At baptism, Michael renounces Satan while his gunmen execute his enemies.
**Psychological Self-Revelation**: None. Michael still believes his superiority and self-righteousness is justified.
**Moral Self-Revelation**: None. Michael has become a ruthless killer. The writers use advanced technique: give moral self-revelation to hero's wife Kay, who sees what he's become as door slams in her face.
**New Equilibrium**: Michael has killed enemies and "risen" to position of Godfather. But morally, he has fallen and become "the devil." He will kill anyone who betrays him or gets in his way.

### Chinatown

**Need**: Jake must overcome cocky arrogance, learn to trust others (psychological). Must stop using people for money and bring a murderer to justice (moral).
**Desire**: Solve the mystery—find out who killed Hollis and why.
**Opponent**: Noah Cross wants to control future of Los Angeles with water scheme. But because *Chinatown* is detective story, Jake and Cross actually compete over **whose version of the truth will be believed**. Cross wants everyone to believe Hollis drowned accidentally and Evelyn's daughter is his granddaughter. Jake wants everyone to believe Cross killed Hollis and raped his own daughter.
**Plan**: Question those who knew Hollis and track the physical evidence connected to his murder.
**Battle**: A cop kills Evelyn, and Noah gets away with Evelyn's daughter while Jake walks off in despair.
**Self-Revelation**: Negative. After Evelyn's death, Jake mumbles "As little as possible." He believes his life is not only useless but destructive. Once again, he has hurt someone he loves.

### Saving Private Ryan

**Need**: Hero John Miller must do his duty in spite of his fear (psychological and moral)
**Desire**: Find Private Ryan and bring him back alive

### The Verdict

**Need**: Hero must regain self-respect (psychological) and learn to act with justice toward others (moral)
**Desire**: Win the case (courtroom drama)

## When Seven Steps May Not Apply

Truby's framework is particularly powerful for:
- Character-driven drama
- Stories focused on personal transformation
- Narratives with clear protagonist-antagonist relationships
- Traditional story forms (novels, screenplays, short stories with conventional structure)

It may be less applicable for:
- Highly experimental or non-linear narratives
- Stories without clear protagonists
- Ensemble pieces without a single hero's journey
- Plotless or avant-garde fiction
- Fragmented/collage narratives

**However**: Even experimental narratives can benefit from understanding the seven steps, either to consciously work with them or deliberately subvert them.

## Using Seven Steps with Non-Traditional Narratives

For fragmented or experimental stories:

**Option 1: Hidden Structure**
The seven steps may exist beneath the surface even if chronology is scrambled. Identify them in narrative time (when events happen) vs. discourse time (when reader encounters them).

**Option 2: Multiple Journeys**
If there are multiple protagonists, each may have their own seven-step structure that intersect.

**Option 3: Truncated or Inverted**
Deliberately truncate the structure (no self-revelation, no new equilibrium) or invert it (self-revelation comes early, creating different effects).

**Option 4: Use as Diagnostic**
Even if not following seven steps, understanding them helps see what's missing—which can then be deliberately omitted or unconventionally arranged.
