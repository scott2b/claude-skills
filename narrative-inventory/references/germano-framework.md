# William Germano's Inventory Framework

*From "On Revision: The Only Writing That Counts" - Chapter: "Know What You've Got" - Section: "Inventory"*

## What is an Inventory?

An inventory at the draft stage is a reminder, a "to-do-or-at-least-don't-forget-about" list. It helps writers:
- Keep fresh in mind what's important about their subject
- Remember what's driving them
- Identify what they want to share (new knowledge, ideas)
- See where their draft is heading
- Find significant points and themes
- Understand what belongs and what doesn't

As Germano notes: "Tell a story. As you revise, work to keep fresh in mind what's driving you, and how you want to share both some form of new knowledge and some idea of that drive."

## Inventory Types

### 1. Simple Topic/Theme Inventory

A basic list of components, topics, or themes you want to make sure you've covered. Like a shopping list - no structure, just items to remember.

**Example:**
```
competing histories of American whiteness
Baldwin's understanding of white self-illusion
histories of failed activism as anti-activism
```

This is "barely a set of notes" - points of interest to consider as you compose.

**When to use**: Early exploratory drafts where you're still figuring out what matters.

### 2. Topic Inventory with Concerns

A list of topics and concerns, showing more clearly where the essay might be heading. Still not a structure, but "a place from which to see a structure. A set of concerns, a point of view."

**Example (Flint water crisis):**
```
incidence of childhood illnesses prior to 2000
incidence of childhood illnesses in 2014-15
lead poisoning
race and the allocation of state resources
the EPA's failure to intervene
the Flint River as industry's dumping ground
children's health initiatives in Flint
Concerned Pastors for Social Action
```

**When to use**: Mid-revision when direction is emerging but still needs clarification.

### 3. Objectives/Ambitions Inventory

Used to "tick off a set of ambitions for your draft." Lists what the writer wants to accomplish, objectives to achieve.

**Example (Valdivia Blackwell article):**
```
make a case for Valdivia Blackwell as an important figure in plant genetics

locate Blackwell's career within a tradition of female researchers
whose contribution was subsumed into the achievements of the (male) team leader

organize the evidence linking Blackwell to the development of the rot-resistant cranberry

tell her story!
```

This includes both materials and tasks - an objective reminding what's important.

**When to use**: When the draft has unclear direction or when you need to refocus on your goals.

### 4. Memoranda Inventory

"Things not to be forgotten" (Latin: memoranda = "things to be remembered"). A reminder to write such things down. Details and materials for further study - things you're interested in but haven't yet fully developed.

This type captures:
- Curiosities to pursue
- Details that may or may not make it into the final text
- Points that will be developed or fall away as writing progresses

**When to use**: Throughout the writing process to capture ideas and questions as they arise.

## Important Principles

### NOT a Structure

Inventories are explicitly NOT outlines or structures. As Germano emphasizes, they're "barely a set of notes," "like a shopping list or a set of points of interest," NOT "a structure, much less an outline."

The inventory "lays out components and emphases so that you can find them to build or rebuild your text" - but it doesn't prescribe how those components should be organized.

### Expect Change

Some items "will be developed and others will fall away." The inventory is a working document, not a contract.

Think of it as a flexible tool that evolves with your thinking, not a fixed plan you must follow.

### Writer-Centered

Focus on what's important TO THE WRITER, not what an external reader might expect. The inventory helps you track what matters to you, what's driving your work.

This is about your interests, your curiosities, your objectives - not fulfilling external expectations.

### No Central Question Yet

At the inventory stage, the writer may have "no central question, much less a thesis." That's perfectly fine and expected. Inventories help you discover direction.

Don't force yourself to have answers before you've done the exploration.

### Multiple Iterations

Inventories can be created multiple times throughout revision as the work develops and changes. Each new inventory reflects your evolving understanding of the project.

Create new inventories as your draft develops - compare them to see how your thinking has shifted.

### Items Can Be Fragmentary

Good inventory items are often:
- Brief and to the point
- Sometimes fragmentary or incomplete
- Written in the writer's thinking voice
- Mix of facts, questions, and curiosities
- Not always in complete sentences

## Examples of Good Inventory Items

From Germano's examples:

- "character of liq—the root is the important piece"
- "what about monks or Crusaders—link of P with liquorice?"
- "tell her story!"
- "organize the evidence linking Blackwell to the development of the rot-resistant cranberry"
- "concerns about abuse of"
- "the role of ammonium chloride in the final preparation"
- "Pontefract—the 'broken bridge' town—home of liquorice? who knew?"
- "Proustian memories"
- "what's appealing about the taste?"

Note how these are:
- In the writer's voice (questions, exclamations, notes-to-self)
- Sometimes fragmentary ("concerns about abuse of" - abuse of what? The writer knows)
- Mix of concrete details and big-picture questions
- Not organized hierarchically

## What Inventories Help You See

After creating an inventory, compare it to your draft to identify:

**What's present and emphasized**: Items that are clearly developed in the current draft

**What's mentioned but underdeveloped**: Items that appear in the draft but need more attention

**What's in the inventory but not yet in draft**: Items you want to include but haven't written yet

**What might be overemphasized**: Topics getting disproportionate attention relative to your stated goals

This comparative view helps you understand gaps, priorities, and where to focus revision energy.

## Key Quotes from Germano

"Tell a story. As you revise, work to keep fresh in mind what's driving you, and how you want to share both some form of new knowledge and some idea of that drive."

"An inventory at the draft stage is a reminder, a to-do-or-at-least-don't-forget-about list."

"This is barely a set of notes, like a shopping list or a set of points of interest. It's not a structure, much less an outline."

"Some of what you jot down will be developed and others will fall away—you can't really know which will be which."

"The inventory lays out components and emphases so that you can find them to build or rebuild your text."
