any connection to the death of Richard II—1400?

what about monks or Crusaders—link of P with liquorice?

effects on endocrine system—how much medical in this essay?

Proustian memories

concerns about abuse of

distinction between liq and similar flavors, such as anise

the role of ammonium chloride in the final preparation

Scandinavian liquorice—the exotic salty sweet

## Analysis

### Already Emphasized in Your Draft
- The town of Pontefract and its connection to liquorice
- Chemical composition and preparation methods
- Distinction between liquorice and similar flavors (anise)
- Scandinavian variations

### Present but Underdeveloped
- Historical connection to Richard II
- Monks/Crusaders bringing liquorice to England
- Proustian memory aspects of the taste
- Medical properties and endocrine effects
- Why the taste appeals to people

### In Your Inventory but Not Yet in Draft
- Dunhill connection (needs clarification)
- Concerns about abuse/overconsumption
- Deeper exploration of "what's appealing about the taste?"

### Observations

Your draft has strong historical and chemical grounding, but you're clearly interested in the experiential and medical dimensions. The inventory shows several underdeveloped threads:

1. **The sensory/memory dimension**: "Proustian memories" and "what's appealing about the taste?" suggest you want to explore the subjective experience, not just facts

2. **Medical significance**: The endocrine effects and abuse concerns hint at a health angle that might deserve more attention

3. **Cultural variations**: The Scandinavian angle is intriguing - is this about how different cultures adapted liquorice?

Consider whether you want this to be primarily:
- Historical (origins, Crusaders, medieval castle)
- Chemical/scientific (preparation, ammonium chloride, endocrine effects)
- Cultural/experiential (taste memories, regional variations, why people love/hate it)

Your inventory suggests you're pulled in all three directions. That's not a problem - but you may want to decide which serves as the primary thread and which are supporting details.

## About This Example

This is based on one of Germano's examples from *On Revision* (pages 66-67), showing how a writer inventorying an essay on liquorice jots down various points of interest. Note:

- Items are brief, sometimes fragmentary
- Some are facts, some are questions, some are curiosities
- There's no hierarchy or organization
- The writer's voice comes through ("who knew?", "what about...")
- It's "barely a set of notes" - but useful for keeping track of what matters
