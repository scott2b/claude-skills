# Story Structure: Twenty-Two Steps (Distilled)

Analyze and develop story structure using John Truby's twenty-two-step framework from *The Anatomy of Story*. These steps provide a precise map of organic plot that solves the fragmented, dead middle problem.

## Purpose

Truby's twenty-two steps are the crucial structure events in an organic plot. Building on the **seven key steps**, the additional fifteen steps are found primarily in the middle where most stories fail. They help create organic plots where events are causally connected, track the hero-opponent dance fighting for the same goal, master suspense through revealing information, build revelations that increase in intensity and pace, ensure character drives plot, and achieve dramatic impact through proper sequencing.

## When to Invoke

Use for:
- Feature-length stories (novels, screenplays, long-form) needing detailed plot structure
- Fixing "dead middle" problems where second act drags or fragments
- Tracking and sequencing revelations to ensure they build properly
- Analyzing drafts to identify missing or weak structural steps
- Creating opponent plans and counterattacks that drive complex plot
- Understanding why plot feels mechanical or predictable
- Building from seven-step foundation to add necessary complexity

**Note**: For short stories/sitcoms/short films, use **story-structure-7-steps** instead. Twenty-two steps are for longer narratives needing additional structure.

## The Twenty-Two Steps: Core Framework

### Organic Plot Principles

**Organic plot** means:
- Actions lead to hero's character change or explain why change is impossible
- Each event is causally connected and essential
- Action is proportionate in length and pacing
- Sequence seems to come naturally from character, not imposed by author
- No part can be displaced without ruin to the whole

**Key**: Plot tracks the hero and opponents fighting for the SAME goal, masterfully managing suspense by withholding and revealing information.

### The Steps Overview

1. **Self-revelation, need, and desire (Frame)** - Combines endpoint (self-revelation) with beginning (weakness, need, desire)
2. **Ghost and story world** - Past event haunting hero; world expressing hero's weakness
3. **Weakness and need** - Psychological/moral flaw; what hero must overcome
4. **Inciting event** - External event causing hero to form goal ("frying pan into fire")
5. **Desire** - Specific goal extending through story (start low, build up)
6. **Ally or allies** - Who helps hero; may have own desire line
7. **Opponent and/or mystery** - Who wants to prevent hero reaching goal; must want SAME goal; hidden iceberg opponent
8. **Fake-ally opponent** - Appears ally but is actually opponent
9. **First revelation and decision** - Explosive new info (about opponent); decision; changed desire and motive
10. **Plan** - Hero's strategy to overcome opponent and reach goal
11. **Opponent's plan and main counterattack** - **Critical often-missing step**: opponent's hidden strategy and attacks
12. **Drive** - Biggest plot section: series of actions, reactions to opponent info; ensure development not repetition; hero begins immoral steps
13. **Attack by ally** - Ally confronts hero's immoral actions
14. **Apparent defeat** - 2/3 to 3/4 through; hero believes they've lost (only ONE defeat)
15. **Second revelation and decision** - New info showing victory possible; hero becomes obsessed/tyrannical; moral decline
16. **Audience revelation** - Audience learns what hero doesn't; often reveals fake-ally opponent's true identity
17. **Third revelation and decision** - Hero discovers (often fake-ally truth); becomes more determined
18. **Gate, gauntlet, visit to death** - Conflict intensifies, options narrow; sudden mortality realization spurs fight
19. **Battle** - Final confrontation in smallest space; **what values are fighting**, not just who's stronger; theme explodes
20. **Self-revelation** - Hero learns who they really are; sudden, shattering, new; through action not statement
21. **Moral decision** - Hero chooses between two values/ways of living; proves self-revelation
22. **New equilibrium** - What has fundamentally changed; higher or lower level

## Task Instructions

### Step 1: Detect Environment & Context

**Determine environment:**
- Claude Code (project access): Has Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep tools
- Claude Desktop/Web: Uploaded files or chat without direct project access

**Understand story context:**
1. Ask which story to analyze/develop
2. Claude Code: Search for story files if not specified (narrative drafts, outlines, structure docs, character notes)
3. Claude Desktop: Ask to describe story or share materials
4. Determine if:
   - New story needing detailed plot structure
   - Existing draft with middle/plot problems
   - Story in development with seven-step foundation needing expansion
   - Plot diagnosis (specific structural problem)

**Length check**: Confirm story is long enough for 22 steps. Short stories/sitcoms typically only hit seven major steps. Feature films/novels/hour-long TV usually need at least twenty-two.

### Step 2: Assess Foundation

**Seven-step check** - Are these defined?
1. Weakness and need
2. Desire
3. Opponent
4. Plan
5. Battle
6. Self-revelation
7. New equilibrium

**If undefined**: Consider using **story-structure-7-steps** skill first, then return.
**If exist**: Proceed to expand with additional fifteen steps.

### Step 3: Choose Analysis Approach

**A. Forward Development (New Story)**
- Start with frame (Step 1: self-revelation, need, desire)
- Work through steps 2-22 systematically
- Build by establishing causal connections
- Focus on organic revelations that build

**B. Reverse Engineering (Existing Draft)**
- Read/analyze existing material
- Identify which twenty-two steps present (explicit or implicit)
- Assess which missing or underdeveloped
- Map existing elements to structure
- Identify where plot weakens or fragments

**C. Plot Diagnosis (Dead Middle/Structural Problem)**
- Identify weak/missing step(s)
- Check if revelations build or stall
- Assess opponent's plan and counterattacks
- Focus on specific structural problem
- Use twenty-two steps to diagnose and solve

Ask writer which approach fits their situation.

### Step 4: Work Through the Steps

For each step, use the framework questions to develop the story structure:

**Step 1 (Frame)**: Establish self-revelation (endpoint), weakness/need, and desire (beginning). Ensure hero is wrong at beginning about what they'll learn at end.

**Step 2**: Identify ghost (past event haunting hero; open wound; counterdesire) and story world (expresses hero's weakness). Determine opening type: community start (paradise), running start (classic - ghost, slavery, weaknesses), or slow start (purposeless hero).

**Steps 3-5**: Detail psychological/moral weakness, need; inciting event; specific desire that starts low and builds.

**Steps 6-8**: Define allies (with own desire lines), opponent (must want SAME goal; necessary opponent who attacks hero's weakness; iceberg hierarchy technique), fake-ally opponent.

**Step 9**: First explosive revelation (about opponent); decision; changed desire and motive.

**Steps 10-11**: Hero's plan; **opponent's plan and hidden counterattacks** (crucial often-missing step - the more intricate and hidden, the better the plot).

**Steps 12-13**: Drive (development not repetition; hero's action changes fundamentally; begins immoral steps); attack by ally (confronts hero's immorality).

**Step 14**: Apparent defeat (only ONE; explosive, devastating).

**Steps 15-17**: Second revelation (obsessive drive, moral decline); audience revelation (knows before hero; distance); third revelation (more determined despite opposition).

**Step 18**: Gate/gauntlet/visit to death (intensify conflict, narrow options; mortality realization spurs fight).

**Step 19**: Battle (smallest space; values fighting; theme explodes; hero most like opponent yet crucial differences clearer).

**Steps 20-21**: Self-revelation (sudden, shattering, through action; optional double reversal); moral decision (choose between values; proves revelation; optional thematic revelation).

**Step 22**: New equilibrium (fundamental change; lasting impact).

### Step 5: Track Revelations Sequence

**Critical technique**: Separate reveals from plot and examine as one unit.

**Create revelations list**: Extract all major revelations. Target: 7-10 for average story; more for detective/thriller. (Industry standard: average hit Hollywood film has 7-10 major reveals.)

**Assess sequence:**
1. **Logical order**: Occur in order hero would most likely learn them?
2. **Build in intensity**: Each stronger (general buildup)?
3. **Increasing pace**: Get closer together as story progresses?

**Quality checks:**
- How many about opponent? (Best kind)
- Any not explosive enough?
- Do breaks in buildup cause plot to stall?
- Is there a reversal where audience's understanding changes instantly?

**Claude Code**: Offer to create revelations sequence document using `assets/revelations-sequence-template.md`.

### Step 6: Verify Organic Connections

**Connection tests:**
- Frame: Self-revelation addresses weakness/need from beginning?
- Desire ↔ Opponent: Competing for SAME goal?
- Opponent ↔ Weakness: Is this necessary opponent (best able to attack hero's great weakness)?
- Revelations: Build logically and intensify?
- Drive: Develops (not repeats same beat)?
- Plot: Seems natural from character rather than author-imposed?

**Causality**: Are all events causally connected? Is each essential?

Identify weak connections and suggest strengthening.

### Step 7: Provide Analysis and Recommendations

**For new stories:**
- Which steps well-defined? Which need development (especially middle)?
- What to work on first?
- Missing connections?
- Opponent's plan detailed enough?

**For existing drafts:**
- Which steps present and working? Which missing/underdeveloped?
- Where does plot fragment or drag (dead middle)?
- How to strengthen weak steps?
- Do revelations build or stall?

**For plot diagnosis:**
- Which step is problem source?
- How to fix it?
- What ripple effects?
- Is middle missing opponent plan/counterattack?

### Step 8: Create Structure Documentation

**If Write tool available (Claude Code with project access):**
1. Get date: `date +%Y-%m-%d`
2. Ask where to save (suggest `structure/` or `process/structure/`)
3. Create directory if needed
4. Use Write tool to save as: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-22-steps.md`
5. Use structure from `assets/22-step-template.md`
6. Include step-by-step breakdown and assessment/recommendations
7. Offer revelations sequence doc: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-revelations-sequence.md`
8. Confirm save location

**If Write tool NOT available (API/Web/Desktop without project):**
1. Return complete file contents in response as formatted markdown
2. Use clear filename header: `# FILE: YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-22-steps.md`
3. Use structure from `assets/22-step-template.md`
4. Include step-by-step breakdown and assessment/recommendations
5. If revelations sequence requested, return as separate section with header: `# FILE: YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-revelations-sequence.md`
6. API consumer can extract and save files from response

## Critical Reminders

- **Build from seven steps**: Twenty-two expands the seven. Ensure seven-step foundation solid first.
- **Flexibility in order**: Steps represent general order humans solve life problems, but every story differs. Beware drastic reordering (risks fake/contrived story).
- **Revelations key**: Plot quality comes down to revelation quality. Target 7-10 major reveals; ensure they build.
- **Opponent's plan crucial**: Most writers miss Step 11. More intricate and hidden = better plot.
- **Development not repetition**: During drive, hero's action changes fundamentally—don't hit same beat.
- **Same goal**: Opponent must want SAME goal as hero (not just oppose hero).
- **Show, don't tell**: Self-revelation through action, not statement.
- **Organic not mechanical**: Plot must seem natural from character, not author-imposed.
- **Solve dead middle**: Additional fifteen steps (beyond seven) map through difficult middle section.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Replace writer's creative vision or storytelling instincts
- Guarantee "good" story (execution matters)
- Work for short stories (use seven-step skill)
- Provide scene-by-scene dialogue or prose (establishes structural foundation)
- Eliminate need for other story elements (character depth, world-building, theme, symbol)
- Work as mechanical formula (must adapt to unique story)

## Integration with Other Skills

- **story-structure-7-steps** - Foundation; twenty-two expands it
- **symbol-web** - Symbols deepen steps with thematic resonance
- **narrative-inventory** - Catalogues draft; twenty-two shows if structure present
- **narrative-keywords** - Identifies themes; twenty-two ensures they build toward self-revelation
- **narrative-maps** - Shows spatial structure; twenty-two shows dramatic structure
