# Truby's 22-Step Story Structure Framework

This reference provides detailed guidance on John Truby's twenty-two building blocks of story structure from *The Anatomy of Story*, Chapter 8: Plot.

## Core Principles

### What is Plot?

Plot is the under-the-surface weaving of various lines of action or sets of events so that the story builds steadily from the beginning through the middle to the end. More particularly, **plot tracks the intricate dance between the hero and all of his opponents as they fight for the same goal**. It is a combination of what happens and how those events are revealed to the audience.

**Key Point**: Your plot depends on how you withhold and reveal information. Plotting involves "the masterful management of suspense and mystery, artfully leading the reader through an elaborate space that is always full of signs to be read, but always menaced with misreading until the very end."

### Organic Plot

A good plot is always organic, which means:

- An organic plot shows the actions that lead to the hero's character change or explain why that change is impossible
- Each of the events is causally connected
- Each event is essential
- Each action is proportionate in its length and pacing
- The amount of plotting seems to come naturally from the main character rather than being imposed by the author
- The sequence of events has a unity and totality of effect

**Edgar Allan Poe**: "In a good plot, no part can be displaced without ruin to the whole."

### Creating Organic Plot: The Sequence

1. Look again at your designing principle (the organic germ of your story)
2. Reacquaint yourself with the theme line (moral argument reduced to single line)
3. If you have a symbol line for the entire story, plot should play it out
4. Decide whether you wish to use a storyteller (big effect on plot)
5. Figure out the structure in detail, using the twenty-two structure steps
6. Decide if you want your story to use one or more genres

### Why 22 Steps?

The twenty-two steps are crucial because they:

- Show you how to create an organic plot regardless of length or genre
- Are the key set of tools for rewriting
- Never tell you what to write (not a formula)
- Show you the most dramatic way to tell your story
- Give you an extremely precise map of your entire plot
- Allow you to build steadily from beginning to end
- Help you avoid the fragmented, dead middle that plagues many stories

**Flexibility**: Think of a story as an accordion. It can have more or fewer than 22 steps:
- Minimum: 7 steps (the essential core)
- Short story/sitcom: Usually hits just the 7 major steps
- Movie/short novel/1-hour TV: Usually has at least 22 steps
- Longer novel: May have 60+ revelations (e.g., David Copperfield)

## The Twenty-Two Steps

The steps represent a detailed choreography of hero versus opponents as the hero tries to reach a goal and solve a much deeper life problem.

## Detailed Step Descriptions

### Step 1: Self-Revelation, Need, and Desire (Frame)

This step represents the overall range of change of your hero in the story. A combination of Steps 20, 3, and 5, this frame gives you the structural "journey" your hero will take.

**Purpose**: By starting with the frame—self-revelation to weakness, need, and desire—you establish the endpoint of the plot first. Then every step you take will lead directly where you want to go.

**Questions to ask**:
- What will my hero learn at the end?
- What does he know at the beginning?
- What is he wrong about at the beginning? (Your hero cannot learn something at the end unless he is wrong about something at the beginning)

**Casablanca Example**:
- Self-Revelation: Rick realizes he cannot withdraw from the fight for freedom simply because he was hurt by love
- Psychological Need: To overcome his bitterness toward Ilsa, regain a reason for living, and renew his faith in his ideals
- Moral Need: To stop looking out for himself at the expense of others
- Desire: To get Ilsa back
- Initial Error: Rick thinks of himself as a dead man, just marking time. The affairs of the world are not his concern.

**Tootsie Example**:
- Self-Revelation: Michael realizes he has treated women as sex objects and, because of that, he has been less of a man
- Psychological Need: To overcome his arrogance toward women and learn to honestly give and receive love
- Moral Need: To stop lying and using women to get what he wants
- Desire: He wants Julie, an actress on the show
- Initial Error: Michael thinks he is a decent person in dealing with women and that it is OK to lie to them

### Step 2: Ghost and Story World

From Step 2 on, work through the structure steps in the order that they occur in a typical story. The number and sequence of steps may differ, depending on your unique story.

#### Ghost

There are two kinds of ghosts in a story:

**First kind (most common)**: An event from the past that still haunts the hero in the present. The ghost is:
- An open wound, often the source of the hero's psychological and moral weakness
- A device that lets you extend the hero's organic development backward
- A major part of the story's foundation
- The hero's internal opponent—the great fear holding him back from action
- A counterdesire: hero's desire drives forward; ghost holds him back

Henrik Ibsen described this as "sailing with a corpse in the cargo."

**Second kind (uncommon)**: No ghost exists because the hero lives in a paradise world. Instead of starting in slavery, the hero begins free. But an attack will soon change all that. (Examples: *Meet Me in St. Louis*, *The Deer Hunter*)

**Caution**: Don't overwrite exposition at the start. Many writers try to tell the audience everything about their hero from the first page, including the how and why of the ghost. This mass of information pushes your audience away. Instead, try withholding information about your hero, including details of his ghost. The audience will come toward your story thinking, "There's something going on here, and I'm going to figure out what it is."

**Timing**: Occasionally, the ghost event occurs in the first few scenes. Much more commonly, another character explains the hero's ghost somewhere in the first third of the story.

#### Story World

The story world is where your hero lives. Comprised of the arena, natural settings, weather, man-made spaces, technology, and time, the world is one of the main ways you define your hero and the other characters.

**Key Point**: The story world should be an expression of your hero. It shows your hero's weaknesses, needs, desires, and obstacles.

**Key Point**: If your hero begins the story enslaved in some way, the story world will also be enslaving and should highlight or exacerbate your hero's great weakness.

**Important**: No matter what kind of story you are writing, you must create a unique and detailed world. Audiences love to find themselves in a special story world. If you provide one, viewers won't want to leave, and they will return to it again and again.

### Step 3: Weakness and Need

**Weakness**: The hero has one or more character flaws that are so serious they are ruining his life.

Weaknesses come in two forms:
- **Psychological**: The inner person is damaged in some way
- **Moral**: The weakness causes someone else to get hurt (always has a direct negative effect on someone else)

These are not mutually exclusive; a character can have both.

**Key Point**: Many writers think they've given their hero a moral weakness when it is only psychological. The key test for a moral weakness is if the hero is clearly hurting at least one other person at the beginning of the story.

**Need**: What the hero must fulfill in order to have a better life. It almost always requires that he overcome his weaknesses by the end of the story.

**Problem**: The trouble or crisis your hero faces at the very beginning of the story. He is aware of the crisis but does not know how to solve it. The problem is usually an outgrowth of the hero's weakness and is designed to quickly show that weakness to the audience. While it should be present at the beginning, it is far less important than weakness and need.

#### Openings

Ghost, story world, weakness, need, and problem constitute the all-important opening of your story. There are three kinds of structural openings:

**Community Start**: Main character lives in a paradise world where land, people, and technology are in perfect harmony. Hero has no ghost, is happy, with only the most minor problem. But he is vulnerable to attack (which will come soon).

**Running Start** (classic opening): Hero has a strong ghost, lives in a world of slavery, has serious weaknesses, has both psychological and moral need, and faces one or more problems. Most good stories use this opening.

**Slow Start**: Involves stories with a purposeless hero. Because the hero's self-revelation is to learn his true desire (and gain a purpose), the first three-quarters of the story have no goal and no narrative drive. Very few stories overcome this huge structural flaw (exceptions: *On the Waterfront*, *Rebel Without a Cause*).

### Step 4: Inciting Event

This is an event from the outside that causes the hero to come up with a goal and take action.

The inciting event connects need and desire. At the beginning, when weakness and need are being established, the hero is typically paralyzed. You need some event to jump-start the hero out of paralysis and force him to act.

**Key Point**: To find the best inciting event, keep in mind the catchphrase "from the frying pan into the fire."

The best inciting event makes your hero think he has just overcome the crisis he has faced since the beginning. In fact, due to the inciting event, the hero has just gotten into the worst trouble of his life.

Example (*Sunset Boulevard*): Joe is an unemployed screenwriter. Two men come to repossess his car, so he takes off. Suddenly, his tire blows (inciting event). Joe turns into Norma Desmond's driveway and thinks he has gotten away. In fact, he has just fallen into a trap from which he will never escape.

### Step 5: Desire

The desire is your hero's particular goal. It provides the spine for the entire plot.

**Requirements for a good desire**:
- Specific and extends through most of the story
- Start the goal at a low level

**Why start low**: One of the ways you build a story is by increasing the importance of the desire as the story progresses. If you start the desire at too high a level, it can't build, and the plot will feel flat and repetitious.

**Important**: As you build the desire, don't create an entirely new desire. Rather, increase the intensity and stakes of the desire you start with.

#### Levels of Desire (lowest to highest)

1. Survive (escape)
2. Take revenge
3. Win the battle
4. Achieve something
5. Explore a world
6. Catch a criminal
7. Find the truth
8. Gain love
9. Bring justice and freedom
10. Save the Republic
11. Save the world

A desire that remains low throughout reduces your hero and makes complexity of plot virtually impossible. For example, simple survival reduces the hero to the level of an animal, and escape stories simply repeat the same beat of running away.

### Step 6: Ally or Allies

Once the hero has a desire line, he will usually gain one or more allies to help him overcome the opponent and reach the goal. An ally is not simply a sounding board for the hero's views. An ally is a key figure in the character web and one of the main ways by which you define your hero.

**Key Point**: Consider giving the ally a desire line of his own. You have relatively little time to define this character. The quickest way to make the audience think they are seeing a complete person is to give that character a goal. Example: The Scarecrow in *The Wizard of Oz* wants a brain.

**Key Point**: Never make the ally a more interesting character than the hero. Always write a story about your most interesting character. If your ally is more interesting than your hero, redesign the story so that the ally is the hero.

#### Subplot

A subplot is used to compare how the hero and another character approach generally the same situation.

**Two key rules about subplot**:

1. The subplot must affect the hero's main plot, or it shouldn't be present at all. To connect the subplot to the main plot, make sure the two dovetail neatly, usually near the end.

2. The subplot character is usually not the ally. The subplot character and the ally have two separate functions. The ally helps the hero in the main plot. The subplot character drives a different but related plot that you compare to the main plot.

**Note**: Subplot is not one of the twenty-two steps because it's not usually present and because it is really a plot of its own with its own structure. But it's a great technique that improves the character, theme, and texture of your story. If you use a subplot, cover all seven key steps or it won't be a complete story and will seem forced.

### Step 7: Opponent and/or Mystery

The opponent is the character who wants to prevent the hero from reaching his goal. The relationship between this character and your hero is the most important in your story. If you set up the opposition properly, your plot will unwind just as it should.

**The necessary opponent**: The best opponent is the character best able to attack the great weakness of your hero. Your hero will be forced either to overcome that weakness and grow or else be destroyed.

**Key questions before introducing your main opponent**:
- Who wants to stop the hero from getting what he wants and why?
- What does the opponent want? (He should be competing for the same goal as the hero)
- What are the opponent's values, and how do they differ from the hero's? (A story without a conflict of values, as well as characters, cannot build)

#### Opponent and Mystery: Two Main Reasons They're Closely Related

1. **A mysterious opponent is more difficult to defeat**: In average stories, the hero's only task is to defeat the opponent. In good stories, the hero has a two-part task: uncover the opponent and then defeat him. This makes the hero's job doubly difficult and his success a far greater accomplishment.

2. **In certain kinds of stories, there must be a mystery to compensate for a missing opponent**: Since detective stories purposely hide the opponent until the end, the audience needs something to replace an ongoing conflict between hero and opponent. In this kind of story, you introduce a mystery at about the time you would normally introduce the main opponent.

#### The Iceberg Opponent

Making the opponent mysterious is extremely important. Think of the opponent as an iceberg. Some is visible above water. But most is hidden below the surface, and that is by far the more dangerous part.

**Four techniques to make opposition as dangerous as possible**:

1. **Create a hierarchy of opponents with a number of alliances**: All opponents are related to one another; they are all working together to defeat the hero. The main opponent sits at the top of this pyramid, with other opponents below him in power.

2. **Hide the hierarchy from the hero and the audience**: Hide each opponent's true agenda (true desire).

3. **Reveal all this information in pieces and at an increasing pace**: You'll have more reveals near the end of the story. How you reveal information to hero and audience is what makes or breaks your plot.

4. **Consider having your hero go up against an obvious opponent early**: As conflict intensifies, have the hero discover attacks from a stronger hidden opposition or from that part of the opponent that has been hidden away.

### Step 8: Fake-Ally Opponent

The fake-ally opponent is a character who appears to be an ally of the hero but is actually an opponent or working for the main opponent.

**Why it's valuable**:
- Plot is driven by reveals, which come from steps the hero takes to uncover the true power of the opposition
- Every time a hero discovers something new about an opponent (a revelation), the plot "turns" and the audience is delighted
- The fake-ally opponent increases the opponent's power because the fact of his opposition is hidden
- Forces the hero and audience to dig below the tip of the iceberg

**Inherent complexity**: This character often undergoes a fascinating change. By pretending to be an ally, the fake-ally opponent starts to feel like an ally. So he becomes torn by a dilemma: he works for the opponent but wants the hero to win.

**Timing**: You usually introduce the fake-ally opponent after the main opponent, but not always. If the opponent has come up with a plan to defeat the hero before the story even begins, you may introduce the fake-ally opponent first.

### Step 9: First Revelation and Decision: Changed Desire and Motive

At this point, the hero gets a revelation (or reveal)—a surprising piece of new information. This information forces him to make a decision and move in a new direction. It also causes him to adjust his desire and his motive. All four of these events should occur at the same time.

**Motive**: Why the hero wants the goal.

**Techniques for quality revelations**:

1. **The best reveals are those where the hero gets information about an opponent**: This kind of information intensifies the conflict and has the most effect on the outcome of the plot.

2. **The changed desire must be a bend of the original desire, not a break in it**: Think of the changed desire as a river that changes course. You don't want to give your hero an entirely new desire at this point, or you have started a new story. You want to adjust, intensify, and build the original desire line.

3. **Each revelation must be explosive and progressively stronger than the one that preceded it**: The information should be important, or it won't pop the story. And each reveal should build on the one before it. When we talk about the plot "thickening," this is what is actually happening. Think of the revelations as the gears in a car. With each reveal the car (story) picks up speed until at the final one the vehicle is zooming.

**If your revelations don't build in intensity, the plot will stall or even decline. This is deadly. Avoid it at all costs.**

**Important**: Hollywood has become more plot-conscious in recent years. Three-act structure requires two or three plot points (reveals)—this is wrong and will give you a lousy plot. **The average hit film in Hollywood today has seven to ten major reveals**. Some kinds of stories (detective, thrillers) have even more.

### Step 10: Plan

The plan is the set of guidelines and strategies the hero will use to overcome his opponent and reach the goal.

**Key Point**: Beware of having your hero simply play out the plan. This gives you a predictable plot and a superficial hero. In good stories, the hero's initial plan almost always fails. The opponent is too strong at this point in the story. The hero needs to dig deep and come up with a better strategy, one that takes into account the power and weapons at the opponent's disposal.

#### Training (Plot Technique)

Most heroes are already trained to do what they must do to succeed. Their failure in the early part of the plot comes because they have not looked within and confronted their weaknesses.

But training is an important part of certain genres (sports, war, suicide mission, caper/heist stories). If you include training in your story, it will probably come right after the plan and before the main action and conflict lines kick in.

### Step 11: Opponent's Plan and Main Counterattack

Just as the hero has a plan and takes steps to win, so does the opponent. The opponent comes up with a strategy to get the goal and begins to execute a line of attack against the hero.

**This step is extremely important, yet most writers are largely unaware of it.**

Plot comes largely from reveals. To get reveals, you have to hide the ways the opponent attacks the hero. So you want to devise a detailed plan for the opponent with as many hidden attacks as possible. Each of these hidden attacks, when sprung on the hero, is another reveal.

**Key Point**: The more intricate the opponent's plan, and the better you hide it, the better your plot will be.

### Step 12: Drive

The drive is the series of actions the hero performs to defeat the opponent and win. Comprising usually the biggest section of the plot, these actions begin with the hero's plan (Step 10) and continue all the way to his apparent defeat (Step 14).

During the drive, the opponent is usually too strong, so the hero is losing. As a result, he becomes desperate and often starts taking immoral steps to win. (These immoral actions are part of the moral argument of the story.)

**Key Point**: During the drive, you want plot development, not repetition. In other words, change the hero's action in a fundamental way. Don't keep hitting the same plot beat (action or event).

For example, in a love story, two characters falling in love may go to the beach, then to the movies, then to the park, and then out to dinner. These may be four different actions, but they are the same plot beat. That's repetition, not development.

**For the plot to develop, you must make your hero react to new information about the opponent (revelations again) and adjust his strategy and course of action accordingly.**

### Step 13: Attack by Ally

During the drive, the hero is losing to the opponent and becoming desperate. When he starts taking immoral steps to succeed, the ally confronts him.

At this moment, the ally becomes the conscience of the hero, saying, in effect, "I'm trying to help you reach your goal, but the way you're doing it is wrong." Typically, the hero tries to defend his actions and does not accept the ally's criticism.

The attack by the ally provides the story with the second level of conflict (hero versus opposition is the first). The ally's attack increases the pressure on the hero and forces him to begin questioning his values and way of acting.

### Step 14: Apparent Defeat

During the drive, the hero is losing to the opponent. About two-thirds to three-quarters of the way into the story, the hero suffers an apparent defeat. He believes he has lost the goal and his opponent has won. This is the hero's lowest point.

**Why it's important**:
- Provides an important punctuation to the overall structure
- It's the moment when the hero hits bottom
- Increases the drama by forcing him to come back from defeat to win at the end
- Just as a sporting event is more exciting when the losing home team comes back to win, so is a story when a hero the audience loves battles back from what seems like certain defeat

**Key Point**: The apparent defeat is not a small or temporary setback. It should be an explosive, devastating moment for the hero. The audience must really feel that the hero is finished.

**Key Point**: You want only one apparent defeat. Although the hero can and should have many setbacks, he should have only one moment that clearly seems to be the end. Otherwise, the story will lack shape and dramatic power. Think of a car barreling down a hill and either going over two or three nasty bumps or smashing into a brick wall.

#### Apparent Victory (for tragic stories)

In stories where the hero ends in greater slavery or death, this step is an apparent victory. The hero reaches the height of success or power, but everything goes downhill from here. This is also the moment when the hero often enters a subworld of temporary freedom.

Example: *Goodfellas*—when the characters pull off the Lufthansa heist. They think they have made the score of a lifetime. In fact, this success begins a process that will end in the death and destruction of them all.

### Step 15: Second Revelation and Decision: Obsessive Drive, Changed Desire and Motive

Just after the apparent defeat, the hero almost always has another major revelation. If he doesn't, the apparent defeat is real, and the story is over.

At this point, the hero gets a new piece of information that shows him that victory is still possible. Now he decides to get back into the game and resume his quest for the goal.

**Galvanizing effect**: This major revelation has a galvanizing effect on the hero. Where before he wanted the goal (desire and drive), now he is obsessed with it. The hero will do virtually anything to win.

In short, at this point in the plot, the hero becomes tyrannical in his quest to win. Notice that while he is strengthened by this information, he is also continuing the moral decline he began during the drive. (This is another step in the moral argument of your story.)

This second revelation also causes the hero to change his desire and motive. Again the story turns in a new direction.

**Make sure that all five of these elements occur, or this moment will deflate and the plot will flag**:
- Revelation
- Decision
- Obsessive drive
- Changed desire
- Changed motive

### Step 16: Audience Revelation

The audience revelation is the moment when the audience—but not the hero—learns an important piece of new information. Often this is when the audience learns the true identity of the fake-ally opponent and the fact that the character they thought was the hero's friend is really an enemy.

**Why this is valuable**:

1. It provides an exciting pop in what is often a slow section of the plot
2. It shows the audience the true power of the opposition
3. It allows the audience to see certain hidden plot elements played out dramatically and visually

**Major shift in relationship**: Notice that the audience revelation marks a major shift in the relationship of hero to audience. In most stories up to this point (farce being a notable exception), the audience learns information at the same time as the hero. This creates a one-to-one connection—an identity—between hero and audience.

But with an audience revelation, for the first time the audience learns something before the hero. This creates distance and places the audience in a superior position to the hero. This allows the audience to step back and see the hero's overall process of change (culminating at the self-revelation).

### Step 17: Third Revelation and Decision

This revelation is another step in the hero's learning what he needs to know to beat the opponent. If the story has a fake-ally opponent, this is often the moment the hero discovers that character's true identity (what the audience learned in Step 16).

As the hero finds out more and more about the true power of the opposition, you might think he would want to back out of the conflict. On the contrary, this information makes the hero feel stronger and more determined to win because he can now see all that he's up against.

### Step 18: Gate, Gauntlet, Visit to Death

Near the end of the story, the conflict between hero and opponent intensifies to such a degree that the pressure on the hero becomes almost unbearable. He has fewer and fewer options, and often the space through which he passes literally becomes narrower. Finally, he must pass through a narrow gate or travel down a long gauntlet (while being assaulted from every direction).

**Visit to Death**: This is also the moment when the hero visits "death."

In myth stories, the hero goes down to the underworld and foresees his own future in the land of the dead.

In more modern stories, the visit to death is psychological. The hero has a sudden realization of his own mortality; life is finite, and it could end very soon. You might think that this realization would cause him to flee the conflict. Instead, it spurs him to fight. The hero reasons, "If my life is to have meaning, I must take a stand for what I believe in. I will take that stand here and now." Thus the visit to death is a testing point that often triggers the battle.

**Most movable step**: The gate, gauntlet, and visit to death is the most movable of the twenty-two steps. For example:
- The hero may visit death during the apparent defeat
- He may pass through the gauntlet during the final battle (trench fight in *Star Wars*, tower in *Vertigo*)
- Or he may pass through it after the battle (*On the Waterfront*)

### Step 19: Battle

The battle is the final conflict. It determines who, if anyone, wins the goal.

**What makes a good battle**: A big, violent conflict, though common, is the least interesting form of battle. A violent battle has lots of fireworks but not much meaning. The battle should give the audience the clearest expression of what the two sides are fighting for. The emphasis should not be on which is the superior force but which ideas or values win out.

**The funnel point of the story**: The battle is the funnel point of the story. Everything converges here. It brings together:
- All the characters
- The various lines of action
- Occurs in the smallest space possible, which heightens the sense of conflict and unbearable pressure

**What happens in the battle**:
- The hero usually (but not always) fulfills his need and gains his desire
- This is where he is most like his main opponent
- But in that similarity the crucial differences between them become even clearer
- The theme first explodes in the minds of the audience—in the conflict of values, the audience sees clearly for the first time which way of acting and living is best

### Step 20: Self-Revelation

By going through the crucible of battle, the hero usually undergoes change. For the first time, he learns who he really is. He tears aside the facade he has lived behind and sees, in a shocking way, his true self.

Facing the truth about himself either destroys him (as in *Oedipus the King*, *Vertigo*, *The Conversation*) or makes him stronger.

**If the self-revelation is moral as well as psychological**, the hero also learns the proper way to act toward others.

**A great self-revelation should be**:
- **Sudden**, for better dramatic effect
- **Shattering** for the hero, whether the self-revelation is positive or negative
- **New**—it must be something the hero did not know about himself until that moment

**Quality**: Much of the quality of your story is based on the quality of the self-revelation. Everything leads to this point. You must make it work.

**Two pitfalls to avoid**:

1. Make sure that what the hero learns about himself is truly meaningful, not just fine-sounding words or platitudes about life

2. Don't have the hero state directly to the audience what he has learned. That is a mark of bad writing.

#### Double Reversal (Advanced Technique)

You may want to give a self-revelation to the opponent as well as to the hero. Each learns from the other, and the audience sees two insights about how to act and live in the world instead of one.

**How to create a double reversal**:

1. Give both the hero and the main opponent a weakness and a need
2. Make the opponent human (capable of learning and changing)
3. During or just after the battle, give the opponent as well as the hero a self-revelation
4. Connect the two self-revelations—the hero should learn something from the opponent, and the opponent should learn something from the hero
5. Your moral vision as the author is the best of what both characters learn

### Step 21: Moral Decision

Once the hero learns the proper way to act in the self-revelation, he must make a decision. The moral decision is the moment when he chooses between two courses of action, each of which stands for a set of values and a way of living that affects others.

**Proof of learning**: The moral decision is the proof of what the hero has learned in the self-revelation. By taking this action, the hero shows the audience what he has become.

#### Thematic Revelation (Advanced Technique)

The thematic revelation is a revelation gained not by the hero but by the audience. The audience sees how people in general should act and live in the world. This allows the story to grow beyond the bounds of these particular characters to affect the audience in their own lives.

Many writers shy away from this advanced technique because they don't want to sound preachy in their final moment with the audience. But done properly, the thematic revelation can be stunning.

**Key Point**: The trick is in how you draw the abstract and the general from the real and the specific of your characters. Try to find a particular gesture or action that can have symbolic impact on the audience.

Example: *Places in the Heart* (final church scene with communion passing through all characters, living and dead, including the murdered sheriff and the boy who killed him, all saying "Peace of God"—a universal forgiveness that evolves from realistic depiction into profound thematic impact).

### Step 22: New Equilibrium

Once the desire and need have been fulfilled (or tragically left unfulfilled), everything goes back to normal. But there is one big difference. Because of his self-revelation, the hero is now at either a higher or a lower level.

## Important Reminders

**Be flexible**: The twenty-two steps are not fixed in their order. They are not a formula by which you whip your story into conformity. This is the general order by which humans try to solve life problems. But every problem and every story is different. Use the twenty-two steps as a framework for the organic unfolding of your unique characters solving their specific problems.

**Beware of breaking the order**: The twenty-two steps represent an organic order, the development of a single unit. So if you try to change the order too drastically in an effort to be original or surprising, you risk a story that seems fake or contrived.

## Revelations Sequence

Good writers know that revelations are the key to plot. Take time to separate the reveals from the rest of the plot and look at them as one unit. Tracking the revelations sequence is one of the most valuable of all storytelling techniques.

**The key is to see if the sequence builds properly**:

1. **The sequence of revelations must be logical**: They must occur in the order in which the hero would most likely learn of them.

2. **They must build in intensity**: Ideally, each reveal should be stronger than the one that came before it. This is not always possible, especially in longer stories. But you want a general buildup so that the drama increases.

3. **The reveals must come at an increasing pace**: This also heightens the drama because the audience gets hit with a greater density of surprise.

### The Reversal Reveal

The most powerful of all reveals is known as a reversal. This is a reveal in which the audience's understanding of everything in the story is turned on its head. They suddenly see every element of the plot in a new light. All reality changes in an instant.

A reversal reveal is most common in detective stories and thrillers:
- *The Sixth Sense*: Bruce Willis character has been dead for most of the movie
- *The Usual Suspects*: Verbal has been making up the entire story and is the terrifying opponent, Keyser Soze

**Advantage**: When the big reversal reveal comes right at the end of the story, it sends the audience out with a knockout punch.

**Caution**: You must be careful with this technique. It can reduce the story to a mere vehicle for plot, and very few stories can support such domination by the plot. O. Henry gained great fame using the reversal technique in his short stories but was also criticized for stories being forced, gimmicky, and mechanical.

## Plot Types (Overview)

Understanding major plot types helps you see different ways storytellers design the sequence of events and create organic plot:

### Journey Plot
Hero goes on a journey encountering a number of opponents in succession. He defeats each one and returns home. The journey provides a physical manifestation of the hero's character change.

**Problems**:
- Hero almost never undergoes character change when defeating each opponent—simply beats the character and moves on (episodic, not organic)
- Hero covers so much space and time that bringing back early characters in a natural way is difficult

### Three Unities Plot
Central technique: unities of time, place, and action (Aristotle). Story must take place in twenty-four hours, in one location, and must follow one action/story line.

**Strength**: Plot is organic because all actions come from the hero in a very short time of development. Opponents the hero knows are present throughout the story.

**Problem**: Not enough plot. Short time period greatly limits the number and power of revelations. Typically get time, opponents, and complexity of action for one big reveal.

### Reveals Plot
Hero generally stays in one place (broader than unity of place—may be a town or city). Almost always covers a longer time period than unity of time (even up to a few years).

**Key technique**: The hero is familiar with his opponents, but a great deal about them is hidden from the hero and the audience. Opponents are very skilled at scheming to get what they want. This combination produces a plot filled with revelations or surprises.

**Basic difference from journey plot**: In journey plot, surprise is limited because hero dispatches large number of opponents quickly. Reveals plot takes few opponents and hides as much about them as possible. Revelations magnify the plot by going under the surface.

**Why organic**: The opponent is the character best able to attack the weakness of the hero, and the surprises come at moments when hero and audience learn how those attacks have occurred. Hero must then overcome weakness and change or be destroyed.

Very popular with audiences because it maximizes surprise. Also known as "big plot." Heyday was the nineteenth century (Dumas, Dickens).

### Genre Plot
Genres are types of stories, with predetermined characters, themes, worlds, symbols, and plots. Genre plots are usually big, emphasizing revelations that are so stunning they sometimes flip the story upside down.

**Strength**: Seem organically connected to main characters simply because they have been written so many times. All padding is gone.

**Weakness**: Lack a huge requirement of an organic plot—they are not unique to their particular main character. They are literally generic, which means they are mechanical.

### Multistrand Plot
Originally devised by novelists and screenwriters, but has really flowered in dramatic television. Each story/episode is comprised of three to five major plot strands. Each strand is driven by a separate character within a single group (police precinct, hospital, law firm). The storyteller crosscuts between strands.

**When executed poorly**: Strands have nothing to do with each other, and crosscut is simply used to increase speed.

**When executed well**: Each strand is a variation on a theme, and the crosscut from one strand to another creates a shock of recognition when two scenes are juxtaposed.

**Can be organic**: Multistrand approach changes the developing unit from the single hero to the group. When the many strands are variations on one theme, the audience more readily experiences who we are as humans.
