## Purpose

Tracking the revelations sequence is one of the most valuable storytelling techniques. This document separates the reveals from the rest of the plot to assess whether the sequence builds properly.

## Revelations Quality Checklist

The revelations sequence must:

1. **Be logical**: Occur in the order the hero would most likely learn them
2. **Build in intensity**: Each reveal should be stronger than the one before (general buildup)
3. **Come at increasing pace**: Greater density of surprise as story progresses
