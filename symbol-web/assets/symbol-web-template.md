## Object Web

**Connecting principle**: [What unifies these objects? How do they derive from designing principle?]

**Objects and their meanings**:

| Object | Meaning | Connects to | Variations |
|--------|---------|-------------|------------|
| [Object 1] | [Symbolic meaning] | [Other objects/characters] | [How it changes] |
| [Object 2] | [Symbolic meaning] | [Other objects/characters] | [How it changes] |
| [Object 3] | [Symbolic meaning] | [Other objects/characters] | [How it changes] |

[List should show how each object refers to other objects]

---

## Genre Context

[If working with/against genre expectations]

**Traditional symbols in this genre**: [List expected symbols]

**Approach**: [Embracing / Reversing / Mixing]

**How symbols are treated**:
- [Fresh take on traditional symbol / Reversal of expectation]
- [Fresh take on traditional symbol / Reversal of expectation]

---

## Symbol Development Tracking

[For each major symbol, show how it evolves through the story]

| Symbol | First Appearance | Key Repetitions | Variations | Final Transformation |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|------------|---------------------|
| [Symbol 1] | [Where/when] | [Key moments] | [How it changes] | [End state] |
| [Symbol 2] | [Where/when] | [Key moments] | [How it changes] | [End state] |

---

## Web Connection Tests

**Verified connections** (symbols that refer to each other):
- [Symbol A] ↔ [Symbol B]: [How they define each other]
- [Symbol C] ↔ [Symbol D]: [Comparison/contrast]

**Oppositions that create depth**:
- [Symbol containing internal opposition and what it reveals]

**Repetition with variation** (strongest examples):
- [Symbol]: [How it's repeated differently to deepen meaning]

---

## Integration Assessment

**How symbols integrate with**:

- **Plot**: [Do symbolic actions emerge from plot necessity?]
- **Character**: [Are character symbols organically connected to their arcs?]
- **Theme**: [Do symbols embody theme without stating it?]
- **World**: [Does world-building serve symbolic purposes?]

---

## Recommendations

### Strengths
- [What's working well in the symbol web]
- [Strong connections or particularly resonant symbols]

### Areas for Development
- [Symbols that need stronger connections]
- [Where repetition with variation could be enhanced]
- [Opportunities for symbol opposition]

### Weak Links or Isolated Symbols
- [Symbols that feel disconnected]
- [Connections that feel arbitrary]

### Specific Actions
1. [Concrete suggestion for deepening symbol integration]
2. [Concrete suggestion for adding variation]
3. [Concrete suggestion for strengthening web]
