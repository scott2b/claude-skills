# Symbol Web (Truby Framework)

This skill helps writers create webs of symbols where each symbol helps define the others through comparison and contrast. Unlike isolated symbols, a symbol web shows deeper truths about how the world works by referring objects, people, and actions to other objects, people, and actions.

## Purpose

Symbols are the most concentrated form of meaning in storytelling. A well-built symbol web creates emotional resonance every time symbols appear, works on the audience unconsciously, shows deeper truth through comparison and contrast, integrates character/plot/theme/world into unified meaning, builds complexity through symbol opposition, and accumulates power through repetition with variation.

## When to Invoke This Skill

Invoke this skill when writers need to:
- Plan symbol systems for a new story
- Connect existing symbols that feel isolated or arbitrary
- Deepen thematic resonance
- Unify multiple plot threads
- Reinvent or subvert genre symbols
- Add coherence to experimental/fragmented narratives
- Revise to add symbolic depth
- Enrich characters, world, or objects with symbolic meaning

## Bundled Resources

**References:**
- `references/truby-framework.md` - Detailed explanation of Truby's 10 symbol web components, how symbols work, principles (repetition with variation, concrete not abstract, symbol opposition), examples (*The Godfather*, *The Scarlet Letter*, *McCabe and Mrs. Miller*), and guidance for fragmented/experimental narratives

## Task Instructions

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps to build or analyze a symbol web.

### Step 1: Detect Environment & Understand Context

**Determine the environment:**
- With access to project directory and file system tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep): Claude Code environment
- With uploaded files or chat without direct project access: Claude Desktop/Web environment

**Understand the story context:**
1. Ask which story to work on
2. In Claude Code: If not specified, search for story files in the project
3. In Claude Desktop: Ask to describe the story or share materials
4. Understand whether this is:
   - A new story needing symbol system design
   - An existing draft with some symbols to analyze
   - A revision focused on deepening symbolic resonance
   - An experimental/fragmented work needing symbolic unity

### Step 2: Identify Existing Foundation

Before building symbol web, identify:

**Story Foundation:**
- **Designing principle**: What is the story about at its core?
- **Theme line**: What moral argument is being made?
- **Story world**: What is the nature of the world and its transitions?
- **Genre** (if applicable): What symbol system does this genre traditionally use?

**Existing Symbols** (if revising):
- What images, objects, characters, actions recur?
- How do they currently relate to each other?
- Which feel isolated vs. connected?
- What's working vs. what feels arbitrary?

Ask clarifying questions to establish these foundations before proceeding.

### Step 3: Create the Symbol Line

Work with the writer to develop a one-sentence symbol line that connects all major symbols:

1. Review designing principle, theme, and story world
2. Identify the core unifying image or pattern
3. Draft symbol line connecting main symbols
4. Test: Does this line emerge organically from story's DNA?

Present the symbol line for feedback and refinement.

**Reference**: See `references/truby-framework.md` for symbol line examples.

### Step 4: Map Symbol Categories

Work through Truby's 10 categories systematically. Consult `references/truby-framework.md` for detailed explanation of each component:

1. **Story Symbol** - Single image expressing fundamental twists, theme, and structure
2. **Symbol Line** - One sentence connecting all main symbols
3. **Symbolic Characters** - Gods, animals, machines; symbol opposition within characters
4. **Symbolic Names** - Names identifying character nature (if appropriate)
5. **Symbol for Character Change** - Symbol arc from beginning to transformation
6. **Symbolic Theme** - Image expressing moral argument, ideally with opposition
7. **Symbolic World** - Natural or social world encapsulated in single image
8. **Symbolic Actions** - Actions that stand out, express theme/character in miniature
9. **Symbolic Objects** - Web of objects connected by designing principle
10. **Reversing Symbols** - Subverting genre expectations (if appropriate)

For each category, explore with the writer using questions in the reference framework.

**Key questions pattern:**
- What image/object/character could serve this function?
- How does it connect to other symbols?
- Does it emerge from the designing principle?
- How will it repeat with variation?

### Step 5: Test Symbol Connections

Verify symbols form web, not isolated elements:

**Connection Tests:**
- Does each symbol refer to others?
- Do symbols create meaningful comparisons?
- Do oppositions deepen meaning?
- Does repetition with variation deepen emotional resonance?

**Identify weak links:**
- Which symbols feel isolated?
- Where are connections arbitrary?
- What needs deeper integration?

### Step 6: Track Symbol Development

For each major symbol, create development chart showing how it evolves through the story (not static). Use the table format from `assets/symbol-web-template.md`.

### Step 7: Assess Integration

Show how symbols integrate with:
- **Plot**: Do symbolic actions emerge from plot necessity?
- **Character**: Are character symbols organically connected to their arcs?
- **Theme**: Do symbols embody theme without stating it?
- **World**: Does world-building serve symbolic purposes?

### Step 8: Provide Recommendations

Based on analysis, offer specific suggestions:

**For new stories:**
- Which symbol categories need development?
- What's the strongest potential unifying symbol?
- Where should symbolic work be focused first?

**For existing drafts:**
- Which symbols are working well?
- What needs connecting to the web?
- Where can repetition with variation deepen resonance?
- What should be cut as arbitrary or disconnected?

**For experimental/fragmented narratives:**
- How can symbol web provide unity without imposing linearity?
- Where should symbols recur to connect fragments?
- What variations will mark temporal/thematic progression?

**Reference**: See `references/truby-framework.md` for special guidance on fragmented/experimental narratives.

### Step 9: Create Symbol Web Documentation

**If in Claude Code (project directory access):**
1. Get current date using `date +%Y-%m-%d` command
2. Ask where to save symbol web documentation (suggest `story-development/` or `planning/`)
3. Create the chosen directory if it doesn't exist
4. Save with descriptive filename using actual date: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-title]-symbol-web.md`
5. Use the structure from `assets/symbol-web-template.md`
6. Confirm the save location

**If in Claude Desktop/Web (no project directory):**
1. Create the symbol web as a formatted markdown artifact or downloadable file
2. Present it in the chat for review
3. Suggest saving with filename using current date: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-title]-symbol-web.md`
4. Use the structure from `assets/symbol-web-template.md`
5. Offer to create alternative formats if requested

## Important Reminders

- **Always create a web**: Symbols work best when connected, not isolated
- **Repetition with variation**: Each appearance should add new dimension
- **Concrete, not abstract**: Ground symbols in specific, sensory details
- **Emerge from designing principle**: Symbols must come from story's DNA, not imposed
- **Work unconsciously**: Let audience discover meaning, don't explain
- **Opposition creates depth**: Richest symbols contain internal contradictions

**Reference**: See `references/truby-framework.md` for detailed principles, common pitfalls, and key quotes.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Replace the writer's creative vision
- Guarantee a "good" story (execution matters)
- Work as mechanical formula (must emerge organically)
- Provide complete story structure (that's for story-structure-7-steps skill)
- Eliminate need for revision and refinement

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works alongside:
- **story-structure-7-steps** - Symbols deepen character arcs and thematic resonance
- **narrative-inventory** - Inventories what exists; symbol web shows how it connects
- **narrative-keywords** - Keywords identify themes; symbols embody them
- **narrative-maps** - Maps show spatial structure; symbols show meaning structure
- Character development tools
- World-building tools
