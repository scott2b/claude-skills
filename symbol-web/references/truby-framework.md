# John Truby's Symbol Web Framework

*From "The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller" - Chapter: "Symbol Web"*

## What is a Symbol Web?

A symbol web creates interconnected symbolic structures where each symbol helps define the others through comparison and contrast. Unlike isolated symbols, a symbol web shows deeper truths about how the world works by referring objects, people, and actions to other objects, people, and actions.

**Key principle**: "Always create a web of symbols in which each symbol helps define the others."

## How Symbols Work

**Pattern**: Feeling → Symbol → Feeling in audience → Changed symbol → Stronger feeling

Symbols create resonance (like ripples in a pond) every time they appear. As symbols are repeated with variation, ripples expand and reverberate, often without conscious awareness.

Symbols are the most concentrated form of meaning in storytelling—they're the most focused condenser-expander of any storytelling technique. A well-built symbol web:
- Creates emotional resonance every time symbols appear
- Works on the audience unconsciously
- Shows deeper truth through comparison and contrast
- Integrates character, plot, theme, and world into unified meaning
- Builds complexity through symbol opposition within elements
- Accumulates power through repetition with variation

## Symbol Systems Integration

- **Character web**: Shows deeper truth through comparing/contrasting people
- **Plot**: Shows deeper truth through surprising but logical sequence of actions
- **Symbol web**: Shows deeper truth by referring objects/people/actions to other objects/people/actions

All three should work together organically.

## The 10 Symbol Web Components

### 1. Story Symbol

A symbol that expresses:
- Fundamental story twists
- Central theme
- Overall story structure
- Unified under one image

**Examples**:
- *The Odyssey*: The long journey that must be endured
- *Huckleberry Finn*: The raft (fragile floating island where equality is possible)
- *The Scarlet Letter*: Letter that transforms from mark of shame to symbol of true morality
- *Heart of Darkness*: The deepest jungle as physical/psychological/moral endpoint

### 2. Symbol Line

Single line connecting all main symbols, derived from:
- Designing principle
- Theme line
- Story world

**Example** (*Exodus*):
- Designing Principle: Man struggles to lead people to freedom and receives moral laws
- Theme Line: Taking responsibility is rewarded by vision of God's word
- Story World: Journey from enslaving city through wilderness to mountaintop
- **Symbol Line**: God's word made physical (burning bush, plagues, Ten Commandments)

### 3. Symbolic Characters

Connect symbols to characters to:
- Define character essence immediately
- Create emotional association
- Build complexity through symbol opposition within character

**Character categories**:
- **Gods**: Elevated status, divine/superhuman qualities
- **Animals**: Grounded in biological drive, divided nature
- **Machines**: Superhuman strength but lacking feeling

### 4. Symbolic Names

Names that immediately identify character's fundamental nature. Works best in comedy or when mixing real/fictional characters (historical icons as mythical gods).

### 5. Symbol Connected to Character Change

Advanced technique:
- Choose symbol character should become after transformation
- Attach symbol to weakness/need at beginning
- Bring symbol back at moment of change with variation

### 6. Symbolic Theme

Encapsulates entire moral arguments in symbol:
- Image/object expressing series of actions that hurt others
- More powerful: Image expressing two conflicting moral sequences

**Best practice**: Work through plot rather than direct statement.

### 7. Symbolic World

Use symbol to encapsulate entire world or set of forces in single image:

**Natural worlds** with inherent power: Island, mountain, forest, ocean

**Social forces** (village → city transitions)

**Institutions/Society**: Matrix/Network as single unit that's also web of enslaving threads

### 8. Symbolic Actions

Connect single action to another action/object for charged meaning:
- Stands out from plot sequence
- Expresses theme or character in miniature
- Calls attention to itself: "This action is especially important"

### 9. Symbolic Objects

Almost never exist alone - create web of objects related by guiding principle. Return to designing principle as glue. Each object refers to and connects with other symbolic objects.

### 10. Symbol Technique: Reversing the Symbol Web

Use audience's knowledge of form to reverse expectations:
- Use all symbols from established genre/form
- Twist meaning to differ from expectations
- Forces rethinking of assumptions

## Important Principles

### Symbols Work Best Unconsciously

Symbols work best when they work on the audience unconsciously through:
- Concrete specificity (not abstraction)
- Repetition with variation (not identical repetition)
- Connection to other symbols (not isolation)

### Repetition with Variation

Don't just repeat the symbol identically. Each appearance should:
- Carry forward the meaning
- Add new dimension or twist
- Deepen emotional resonance
- Build toward transformation

### Concrete, Not Abstract

Symbols work through specific, sensory, physical detail. Abstract symbols lack power. Ground every symbol in concrete story details that the audience can see, hear, touch, smell.

### Symbol Opposition Creates Complexity

The richest symbols contain opposition within themselves:
- Character who is both god and animal
- Object that represents both freedom and imprisonment
- Action that is both sacrifice and violence

### Emergence from Designing Principle

Symbols must emerge organically from the story's DNA (designing principle), not be imposed from outside. If symbols feel arbitrary or forced, they likely don't connect to the story's core.

### Genre Symbols Can Be Embraced or Reversed

Understanding genre's traditional symbol web lets you either:
- Work with it (making it fresh through specific details and variations)
- Deliberately subvert it (forcing audience to rethink assumptions)

## Examples from Truby

### *The Godfather* - Symbol of Character Change

- **Opening**: Vague hint at Faustian bargain with devil
- **Climax**: Michael renounces Satan while becoming Satan (baptism scene)
- **Self-revelation**: Door closes on Kay - he's become new underworld king
- **Symbol arc**: Man → Devil, shown through visual symbol of door closing

The symbol of the door/threshold tracks Michael's transformation. Beginning: Open doors, family gatherings. Middle: Doors as boundaries between worlds. End: Door literally closes on Kay, shutting her out from truth - he's become the new devil.

### *The Scarlet Letter* - Symbolic Theme

- Appears to represent moral argument against adultery
- Actually represents two opposing moralities: inflexible public chastisement vs. true private love
- Letter transforms from mark of shame to symbol of true morality
- Entire moral complexity concentrated in one symbol

This is symbol at its most powerful - containing the central moral opposition of the entire story within a single object.

### *McCabe and Mrs. Miller* - Reversing the Symbol Web

Reverses traditional Western symbols:

| Traditional Western | *McCabe* Reversal |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Hero: Lawman | Gambler/dandy with whorehouse |
| Love interest: Schoolmarm | Opium-smoking madam |
| Town: Dry Southwest plain | Makeshift wood/tent in rainy Northwest forest |
| Showdown: Noon gunfight in dusty street | Chased through snowstorm, unseen by townspeople |
| Weapon: Six-shooter | Hidden derringer (woman's weapon) |
| Clothing: Chaps, wide-brimmed hat | Eastern suit and bowler |

Forces audience to rethink assumptions about Western mythology and American frontier mythos.

## Special Case: Fragmented/Experimental Narratives

For non-linear, fragmented, or experimental stories:

### Symbol as Connective Tissue

In narratives like *Ulysses* or *Moby Dick*:
- Symbols connect fragments across time and space
- Recurring symbol creates continuity in discontinuity
- Symbol variation marks temporal/thematic progression
- Audience assembles meaning through symbolic resonance

### Layering Symbol Systems

Overlay multiple symbol systems for depth:
- Character A references both Odysseus (mythic journey) and Christ (sacrifice)
- Setting contains both Eden (garden) and Babylon (corrupt city)
- Objects reference both natural (stone) and artificial (machine) symbol sets

### Symbol as Structure

Use symbol web as organizing principle:
- Chapter breaks at symbolic transformations
- Section titles from symbolic objects
- Narrative voice emerging from central symbol
- Physical artifact (like Elvis Bible) as both content and structure

## Common Pitfalls

### DON'T:
- Create single isolated symbol (no web)
- Over-explain symbolic meaning (let audience discover)
- Force symbols into story that don't emerge organically from designing principle
- Use obvious symbolism without twist or depth
- Present symbols without variation/development
- Make symbols abstract rather than concrete and specific
- Repeat symbols identically without variation
- Impose symbols from outside rather than deriving from story's DNA

### DO:
- Create web where symbols define each other
- Repeat symbols with subtle variations
- Ground symbols in concrete story details
- Let symbols emerge from designing principle
- Trust audience to make connections
- Consider symbol opposition within elements
- Test that symbols connect to plot, character, theme, and world
- Revise to deepen symbol integration
