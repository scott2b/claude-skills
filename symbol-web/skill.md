# Symbol Web (Truby Framework)

This skill helps writers create **webs of symbols** where each symbol helps define the others through comparison and contrast. Unlike isolated symbols, a symbol web shows deeper truths about how the world works by referring objects, people, and actions to other objects, people, and actions.

## Purpose

Symbols are the most concentrated form of meaning in storytelling - they're the most focused condenser-expander of any storytelling technique. A well-built symbol web:
- Creates emotional resonance every time symbols appear
- Works on the audience unconsciously
- Shows deeper truth through comparison and contrast
- Integrates character, plot, theme, and world into unified meaning
- Builds complexity through symbol opposition within elements
- Accumulates power through repetition with variation

As Truby emphasizes: "Always create a web of symbols in which each symbol helps define the others."

**Key principle**: Symbols work best when they work on audience unconsciously through concrete specificity, repetition with variation, and connection to other symbols (not isolated).

## When to Invoke This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Planning symbol systems for a new story
- Existing symbols feel isolated or arbitrary
- Wanting to deepen thematic resonance
- Story has multiple plot threads that need unifying
- Genre symbols feel clichéd and need reinvention
- Experimental/fragmented narrative needs coherence
- Revising to add symbolic depth
- Characters, world, or objects need symbolic enrichment

## Core Concepts from Truby

### How Symbols Work

**Pattern**: Feeling → Symbol → Feeling in audience → Changed symbol → Stronger feeling

Symbols create resonance (like ripples in a pond) every time they appear. As you repeat the symbol with variation, ripples expand and reverberate, often without conscious awareness.

### Symbol Systems Integration

- **Character web**: Shows deeper truth through comparing/contrasting people
- **Plot**: Shows deeper truth through surprising but logical sequence of actions
- **Symbol web**: Shows deeper truth by referring objects/people/actions to other objects/people/actions

All three should work together organically.

## The 10 Symbol Web Components (from Truby)

### 1. Story Symbol
A symbol that expresses:
- Fundamental story twists
- Central theme
- Overall story structure
- Unified under one image

**Examples**:
- *The Odyssey*: The long journey that must be endured
- *Huckleberry Finn*: The raft (fragile floating island where equality is possible)
- *The Scarlet Letter*: Letter that transforms from mark of shame to symbol of true morality
- *Heart of Darkness*: The deepest jungle as physical/psychological/moral endpoint

### 2. Symbol Line
Single line connecting all main symbols, derived from:
- Designing principle
- Theme line
- Story world

**Example** (*Exodus*):
- Designing Principle: Man struggles to lead people to freedom and receives moral laws
- Theme Line: Taking responsibility is rewarded by vision of God's word
- Story World: Journey from enslaving city through wilderness to mountaintop
- **Symbol Line**: God's word made physical (burning bush, plagues, Ten Commandments)

### 3. Symbolic Characters
Connect symbols to characters to:
- Define character essence immediately
- Create emotional association
- Build complexity through symbol opposition within character

**Character categories**:
- **Gods**: Elevated status, divine/superhuman qualities
- **Animals**: Grounded in biological drive, divided nature
- **Machines**: Superhuman strength but lacking feeling

### 4. Symbolic Names
Names that immediately identify character's fundamental nature. Works best in comedy or when mixing real/fictional characters (historical icons as mythical gods).

### 5. Symbol Connected to Character Change
Advanced technique:
- Choose symbol character should become after transformation
- Attach symbol to weakness/need at beginning
- Bring symbol back at moment of change with variation

### 6. Symbolic Theme
Encapsulates entire moral arguments in symbol:
- Image/object expressing series of actions that hurt others
- More powerful: Image expressing two conflicting moral sequences

**Best practice**: Work through plot rather than direct statement.

### 7. Symbolic World
Use symbol to encapsulate entire world or set of forces in single image:

**Natural worlds** with inherent power: Island, mountain, forest, ocean

**Social forces** (village → city transitions)

**Institutions/Society**: Matrix/Network as single unit that's also web of enslaving threads

### 8. Symbolic Actions
Connect single action to another action/object for charged meaning:
- Stands out from plot sequence
- Expresses theme or character in miniature
- Calls attention to itself: "This action is especially important"

### 9. Symbolic Objects
Almost never exist alone - create web of objects related by guiding principle. Return to designing principle as glue. Each object refers to and connects with other symbolic objects.

### 10. Symbol Technique: Reversing the Symbol Web
Use audience's knowledge of form to reverse expectations:
- Use all symbols from established genre/form
- Twist meaning to differ from expectations
- Forces rethinking of assumptions

## Task Instructions

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Detect Environment & Understand Context

**First, determine your environment:**
- If you have access to a project directory and file system tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep): You are in **Claude Code**
- If the user uploaded files or you're working in a chat without direct project access: You are in **Claude Desktop/Web**

**Then understand the story context:**
1. Ask the user which story they want to work on
2. In Claude Code: If not specified, search for story files in the project
3. In Claude Desktop: Ask the user to describe their story or share materials
4. Understand whether this is:
   - A new story needing symbol system design
   - An existing draft with some symbols to analyze
   - A revision focused on deepening symbolic resonance
   - An experimental/fragmented work needing symbolic unity

### Step 2: Identify Existing Foundation

Before building symbol web, identify:

**Story Foundation:**
- **Designing principle**: What is the story about at its core?
- **Theme line**: What moral argument is being made?
- **Story world**: What is the nature of the world and its transitions?
- **Genre** (if applicable): What symbol system does this genre traditionally use?

**Existing Symbols** (if revising):
- What images, objects, characters, actions recur?
- How do they currently relate to each other?
- Which feel isolated vs. connected?
- What's working vs. what feels arbitrary?

**Ask clarifying questions** to establish these foundations before proceeding.

### Step 3: Create the Symbol Line

Work with the user to develop a one-sentence symbol line that connects all major symbols:

1. Review designing principle, theme, and story world
2. Identify the core unifying image or pattern
3. Draft symbol line connecting main symbols
4. Test: Does this line emerge organically from story's DNA?

**Present the symbol line** for user feedback and refinement.

### Step 4: Map Symbol Categories

Work through each of Truby's 10 categories systematically:

#### A. Story Symbol (Overall)

**Questions to explore:**
- What single image could express your story's fundamental twists?
- What symbol could unify theme and structure?
- What image contains the whole story in miniature?

**Examples to consider**: Journey, prison, mask, mirror, bridge, etc.

#### B. Symbolic Characters

**For hero, opponent, and key supporting characters:**

**Questions:**
- What type? (God, animal, machine, or combination?)
- What single aspect or emotion does symbol capture?
- Is there symbol opposition WITHIN the character?
- How does symbol evolve through story?

**Technique**: Begin with hero/opponent opposition, choose single aspect, consider internal opposition, repeat symbol with variations.

#### C. Symbolic Names (if appropriate)

**Questions:**
- Do names immediately identify character nature?
- Is this story suited to symbolic names (comedy, myth, mixing real/fictional)?
- What would names reveal about essence?

#### D. Symbol for Character Change

**Questions:**
- What symbol should character become after transformation?
- How can you attach symbol to weakness/need at beginning?
- How will symbol return at moment of change with variation?

**Map the arc**: Symbol at beginning → Symbol through middle → Symbol transformed at end

#### E. Symbolic Theme

**Questions:**
- What image/object could express your moral argument?
- Can you find image expressing TWO conflicting moral sequences?
- How can plot embody this symbol rather than stating it?

#### F. Symbolic World

**Questions:**
- What single image could encapsulate your entire world?
- Is it natural (island, mountain, forest) or social (city, institution)?
- What transitions occur (village → city, innocence → experience)?
- Can specific locations become symbolic through detail?

#### G. Symbolic Actions

**Questions:**
- What actions should stand out from plot sequence?
- What actions express theme or character in miniature?
- What moments should signal "especially important"?

**List 3-5 key symbolic actions** with their meanings.

#### H. Symbolic Objects

**This is usually the richest category.**

**Questions:**
- What objects recur or could recur?
- What's the connecting principle (designing principle)?
- How does each object refer to other objects?
- Is there a genre-specific symbol set to work with/against?

**Create object web**: List objects and show connections between them.

#### I. Genre Context (if applicable)

**Questions:**
- What symbols does your genre traditionally use?
- Will you embrace or reverse these symbols?
- How can you make them fresh while honoring form?

#### J. Reversing Symbols (if appropriate)

**Questions:**
- Are you deliberately subverting audience expectations?
- What symbols from established form will you twist?
- How will reversal serve your story's deeper truth?

### Step 5: Test Symbol Connections

Verify symbols form web, not isolated elements:

**Connection Tests:**
- Does each symbol refer to others?
- Do symbols create meaningful comparisons?
- Do oppositions deepen meaning?
- Does repetition with variation deepen emotional resonance?

**Identify weak links:**
- Which symbols feel isolated?
- Where are connections arbitrary?
- What needs deeper integration?

### Step 6: Track Symbol Development

For each major symbol, create development chart:

| Symbol | First Appearance | Key Repetitions | Variations | Final Transformation |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|------------|---------------------|
|        |                  |                 |            |                     |

This shows how symbols evolve rather than remain static.

### Step 7: Assess Integration

Show how symbols integrate with:
- **Plot**: Do symbolic actions emerge from plot necessity?
- **Character**: Are character symbols organically connected to their arcs?
- **Theme**: Do symbols embody theme without stating it?
- **World**: Does world-building serve symbolic purposes?

### Step 8: Provide Recommendations

Based on analysis, offer specific suggestions:

**For new stories:**
- Which symbol categories need development?
- What's the strongest potential unifying symbol?
- Where should you focus symbolic work first?

**For existing drafts:**
- Which symbols are working well?
- What needs connecting to the web?
- Where can repetition with variation deepen resonance?
- What should be cut as arbitrary or disconnected?

**For experimental/fragmented narratives:**
- How can symbol web provide unity without imposing linearity?
- Where should symbols recur to connect fragments?
- What variations will mark temporal/thematic progression?

### Step 9: Create Symbol Web Documentation

Create comprehensive documentation showing:

### Step 10: Save or Present the Analysis

**If in Claude Code (project directory access):**
1. Ask where to save symbol web analyses (suggest `structure/` or `process/symbol-webs/`)
2. Create the chosen directory if it doesn't exist
3. Save with descriptive filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-symbol-web.md`
4. Include both the comprehensive documentation and recommendations
5. Confirm the save location to the user

**If in Claude Desktop/Web (no project directory):**
1. Create the analysis as a formatted markdown artifact or downloadable file
2. Present it in the chat for the user to review
3. Suggest the user save it with filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-symbol-web.md`
4. Offer to explore any specific symbol category in more depth if requested

## Important Principles

### Symbols Work Best Unconsciously

Don't announce symbolism. Let symbols accumulate meaning through:
- Concrete specificity (not abstract)
- Repetition with variation (not static)
- Connection to other symbols (not isolated)
- Emergence from story organically (not imposed)

The symbol web should feel inevitable in retrospect, surprising in the moment, and emotionally resonant throughout.

### Start with Designing Principle

The symbol web must emerge from your story's DNA - its designing principle, theme, and world. Symbols imposed from outside feel arbitrary.

### Create Webs, Not Isolated Symbols

A single symbol is weak. Symbols that refer to and define each other create resonance and depth.

### Repetition with Variation

Don't just repeat symbols identically. Each recurrence should:
- Remind audience of previous appearance
- Add new dimension or twist
- Deepen emotional impact through accumulated meaning

### Grounded in Concrete Detail

Symbols work through specific, sensory, physical detail. Abstract symbols lack power.

### Symbol Opposition Creates Complexity

The richest symbols contain opposition within themselves:
- Character who is both god and animal
- Object that represents both freedom and imprisonment
- Action that is both sacrifice and violence

### Genre Symbols Can Be Embraced or Reversed

Understanding genre's traditional symbol web lets you either work with it (making it fresh) or deliberately subvert it.

## Examples from Truby

### *The Godfather* - Symbol of Character Change
- **Opening**: Vague hint at Faustian bargain with devil
- **Climax**: Michael renounces Satan while becoming Satan (baptism scene)
- **Self-revelation**: Door closes on Kay - he's become new underworld king
- **Symbol arc**: Man → Devil, shown through visual symbol of door closing

### *The Scarlet Letter* - Symbolic Theme
- Appears to represent moral argument against adultery
- Actually represents two opposing moralities: inflexible public chastisement vs. true private love
- Letter transforms from mark of shame to symbol of true morality
- Entire moral complexity concentrated in one symbol

### *McCabe and Mrs. Miller* - Reversing the Symbol Web
Reverses traditional Western symbols:
- Hero: Gambler/dandy with whorehouse, not lawman
- Love interest: Opium-smoking madam
- Town: Makeshift wood/tent in rainy Northwest forest, not dry Southwest plain
- Showdown: Chased through snowstorm, unseen by townspeople, shot with hidden derringer (woman's weapon)
- Clothing: Eastern suit and bowler, not chaps and wide-brimmed hat

Forces audience to rethink assumptions about Western mythology.

## Special Case: Fragmented/Experimental Narratives

For non-linear, fragmented, or experimental stories:

### Symbol as Connective Tissue
In narratives like *Ulysses* or *Moby Dick*:
- Symbols connect fragments across time and space
- Recurring symbol creates continuity in discontinuity
- Symbol variation marks temporal/thematic progression
- Audience assembles meaning through symbolic resonance

### Layering Symbol Systems
Overlay multiple symbol systems for depth:
- Character A references both Odysseus (mythic journey) and Christ (sacrifice)
- Setting contains both Eden (garden) and Babylon (corrupt city)
- Objects reference both natural (stone) and artificial (machine) symbol sets

### Symbol as Structure
Use symbol web as organizing principle:
- Chapter breaks at symbolic transformations
- Section titles from symbolic objects
- Narrative voice emerging from central symbol
- Physical artifact (like Elvis Bible) as both content and structure

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Replace the writer's creative vision
- Guarantee a "good" story (execution matters)
- Work as mechanical formula (must emerge organically)
- Provide complete story structure (that's for seven-steps skill)
- Eliminate need for revision and refinement

## Integration with Other Tools

This skill works alongside:
- **Story structure (seven steps)**: Symbols deepen character arcs and thematic resonance
- **Narrative inventory** (Germano): Inventories what you have; symbol web shows how it connects
- **Narrative keywords** (Germano): Keywords identify themes; symbols embody them
- **Narrative maps** (Germano): Maps show spatial structure; symbols show meaning structure
- **Character development**: Symbols define character essence and change
- **World-building**: Symbols make worlds meaningful beyond description

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### DON'T:
- Create single isolated symbol (no web)
- Over-explain symbolic meaning (let audience discover)
- Force symbols into story that don't emerge organically from designing principle
- Use obvious symbolism without twist or depth
- Present symbols without variation/development
- Make symbols abstract rather than concrete and specific
- Repeat symbols identically without variation
- Impose symbols from outside rather than deriving from story's DNA

### DO:
- Create web where symbols define each other
- Repeat symbols with subtle variations
- Ground symbols in concrete story details
- Let symbols emerge from designing principle
- Trust audience to make connections
- Consider symbol opposition within elements
- Test that symbols connect to plot, character, theme, and world
- Revise to deepen symbol integration
