# Myth Story Beats: Distilled Reference

Based on John Truby's "Myth: The Life Process" from *The Anatomy of Genres*

## Core Principles

**Myth is the essential mind in story form** - the first Story Code that consciousness constructs, the shape of basic human consciousness.

**Key Point:** Myth is primarily about the development of the self over a lifetime.

**Immortality is the main theme** - Most religions are collections of stories designed to lay out a moral code necessary to achieve immortality.

**The Myth Mind-Action:** Life is a journey in which one's ultimate goal is to understand oneself. The hero encounters opponents on a journey that exposes their deeper self, leading to self-revelation and character change.

**Technique:** Every landmark in the character's outer journey must be a physical manifestation of inner change.

## Story World (Most Important Element)

**Key Point:** The story world is the most important major story element in the Myth form. The reader immerses in the world and explores it.

### Seven Steps for Creating Story World

**Step 1: Define Overall Arena**
Unified place surrounded by boundary, with multiple subworlds providing unity, distinctiveness, and diversity.

**Step 2: Land-People-Technology Interaction**
- **LAND:** Natural settings (forests, rivers, mountains, deserts, oceans, etc.)
- **PEOPLE:** Society, culture, man-made spaces
- **TECHNOLOGY:** Primary tools (animal, magical, mechanical, digital)
Unique combination creates distinctive world.

**Step 3: Value Oppositions**
Two competing cultures with opposing values. What is most valued becomes what is worshipped.

**Step 4: Subworlds Based on Values**
- **UTOPIA (Freedom):** Land-people-technology in balance = community. Represents success, fulfillment, hero's rise, positive change.
- **DYSTOPIA (Slavery):** Out of balance = harsh predatory world. Represents failure, weaknesses, decline, negative change.

**Step 5: Social System**
Hierarchy of power, rules of operation. The system traps; the culture justifies.

**Step 6: Technology and Magic System**
Define powers, who has them, limits, acquisition methods. **Key:** More magic power = less vulnerable = less useful to story.

**Step 7: World Development**
Begin with world of slavery (expresses hero's weakness). World changes as hero changes.

## Character Web: Great Chain of Being

Hierarchy of all beings in the world (gods → angels → demons → superheroes → heroes → kings → nobles → commoners → animals → plants → minerals → nonbeing).

**Key Point:** An original Myth doesn't require all types but needs detailed hierarchy placing humans within natural world.

**Technique:** Connect the Great Chain to society that is either utopia or dystopia.

## Character Archetypes

Each archetype has essential strength and "shadow" (deep weakness).

**1. Warrior**
- Strength: Practical enforcer of right
- Shadow: Kill or be killed, destroy the weak
- Examples: Hercules, Luke Skywalker, Katniss Everdeen

**2. Searcher**
- Strength: Committed to questioning and self-improvement
- Shadow: Purposeless and uncommitted
- Examples: Knights seeking Holy Grail, detectives

**3. Teacher (Wise Old Man/Woman)**
- Strength: Spreads knowledge for better living
- Shadow: Forces thinking or self-glorification
- Examples: Yoda, Gandalf, Mary Poppins

**4. Rebel**
- Strength: Acts against enslaving system
- Shadow: Provides no better alternative
- Examples: Prometheus, Neo, Tris

**5. Trickster**
- Strength: Defeats unjust power
- Shadow: Lies, cheats, steals
- Examples: Odysseus, Loki, Joker

## The Sixteen Myth Story Beats

### Beat 1: Ghost—Difficult Birth/Rebirth
Many Myths begin with difficult birth; hero loses father/mother. Modern technique: Begin with rebirth of hero for quicker start.

### Beat 2: Weakness-Need—Becoming a Hero
Hero needs to become heroic (not conscious desire). Often based on loss of parent.

### Beat 3: Inciting Event—Talisman
Hero gains talisman (object with unknown power that expresses hero's identity/destiny). For male Myth: often sword. For female Myth: often non-violent object.

### Beat 4: Desire—Journey and Destiny
Goal embedded within hero (what born to do). Journey has specific end point. Often circular (returns home).

**Meander Plot Shape:** Winding path, many successive opponents. Plot comes from encountering new opponents at different levels of society.

**Technique:** External = Internal Journey. Physical journey manifests internal change.

### Beat 5: Allies—Wise Old Man/Woman
Companions including Teacher archetype. What they lack that journey reveals they always had.

### Beat 6: Opponent—Successive Strangers
Due to journey form, opponents tend to be strangers in succession (creates episodic challenge).

**Technique:** Each opponent represents aspect hero must overcome in self. Each defeat = mini self-revelation.

**Best Opponent Technique: Family Trip** - Hero takes family along, providing ongoing intimate opponents plus episodic ones.

**Technique: Ongoing Main Opponent** - At least one opponent present throughout.

**Key Point:** In Myth, nothing is chance. Each opponent challenges hero at weakest point.

### Beat 7: Drive—Symbolic Objects
Most symbolic genre. External symbols mean something within hero.

**Symbolic categories:**
- **Characters:** Animals (path models), machine (efficient but heartless), devil (temptation)
- **Paths:** Journey (life span), labyrinth (death/confusion), ladder (stages to enlightenment)
- **Objects:** Tree (life/knowledge), cross (rebirth), shadow (dark side/growth source), talismans (right action)
- **Places:** Underworld (death/unexplored self), garden (harmony with natural law)

**Key Point:** Symbols ambiguous, depend on context.

### Beat 8: Revelation—Opponents Attack
Hero learns about each opponent's attack method, creates unique plans, has mini self-revelations.

### Beat 9: Gate, Gauntlet, Visit to Underworld
Conflict intensifies, pressure becomes unbearable, options narrow. Hero visits underworld (land of dead), sees ancestors/future, recognizes unexamined self, realizes mortality, makes narrow escape.

### Beat 10: Battle

**Male Myth:** Big violent battle. Stakes epic. Hero defeats greatest opponent but may die.

**Female Myth:** No violent battle. Hero solves problem through resourcefulness, not combat.

**Key:** Values fighting, not just who is stronger.

### Beat 11: Self-Revelation—Public/Cosmic
Not just personal revelation. Two forms:

**1. Public Revelation:** Hero learns identity as king/chosen leader. Understands special responsibility to community. Health of kingdom depends on quality of king.

**2. Cosmic Revelation:** Hero gains moral vision/epiphany of how society should exist. Must be detailed to have meaning.

**Technique: Mythic vs Tragic Ending**
- **Mythic:** Immortality of hero (even through story)
- **Tragic:** Life cut off too early, no rebirth, revelation comes too late

### Beat 12: New Equilibrium—Outgrow the Code
Hero returns home profoundly changed. Often marries/remarries.

Instead of changing beliefs, hero has outgrown the code entirely. Spiritually reborn.

**In spiritual rebirth:**
- Sees world and acts in new way
- In tune with destiny and larger forces of nature

## Theme: Being Is Self-Questioning and Search for Destiny

**Key Point:** Becoming who you are isn't passive "be yourself." It's the most active, difficult work we will ever do.

Being means constantly questioning oneself, especially about morality of actions. Self-questioning means attacking oneself to get at truth.

Being is also search for destiny (what someone was born to do). Destiny comes from within, from abilities one isn't fully aware of.

**Key Point:** Myth says being is becoming. Being (tactics of present) is in constant conflict with becoming (strategic vision) and must be reconciled.

**Myth Thematic Recipe: The Way of the Searcher**
Hero's basic action is to seek. Real question: What is my destiny? What was I born to do?

If you can find and do it, you will have good life and gain immortality.

Second part: Finding place in natural order. Living enlightened life is living in cosmic harmony—seeing how elements depend on one another, acting without placing ambition above others' lives.

## Male Myth vs Female Myth

**Key Point:** Basic thematic difference: **Male Myth is divide and conquer; Female Myth is combine and grow.**

### Male Myth Characteristics
- Linear plot (hunt/quest)
- Hero typically warrior
- Emphasis on battles, physical conflict
- Ends with violent battle
- Values: divide and conquer
- Shame culture (reputation, honor)
- Loss of father
- Sword as talisman

### Female Myth Characteristics
- Circular/cyclical plot (agricultural cycle, seasons)
- Hero emphasizes growth and connection
- Multiple rebirths throughout story
- Ends with return home, community restoration
- Values: combine and grow
- Guilt culture (relationships, responsibility)
- Good witches and evil (celebrating female power)
- Non-violent talisman (seeds, shoes)
- Allies non-traditional (not warriors)
- Male allies may be fake/weak but not evil
- Battle is non-violent problem-solving

**The shift from Male to Female Myth:** From warrior-shame culture to guilt culture, from revenge to forgiveness, from individual glory to community harmony.

## Transcending Myth

### 1. Creation Myth / Myth-Science Fiction Epic
Tracks development of culture, worldwide zeitgeist, Universal Mind.

**Creation Myth:** Not about creating physical world, but creating consciousness and culture. Lays out values for good life.

**Origin Story:** Tracks beginning of particular character (not whole culture). Popular because it shows birth of mythology and creates plot from character.

### 2. Female Myth (Primary Focus)
Female-dominated world, good witches celebrated, multiple rebirths, combine and grow emphasized.

Examples: *Wizard of Oz*, *Avatar*, *Arrival*, *Inside Out*

### 3. Ecological Myth
Tracks invasion of natural world by technological force. Hero changes from technological to natural being. Final rebirth: hero combines nature and technology, establishes harmony.

**Negative version: Machine in the Garden** - Hero tries to defend nature but loses. Machine destroys garden.

## Key Distinctions

- **Story world is most important element** in Myth (not character or plot)
- **Immortality is central theme** (literal, through legacy, or tragic failure)
- **Physical journey = internal change** (not separate)
- **Myth hero is Searcher** (searches for destiny, meaning)
- **Great Chain of Being** creates hierarchy of all beings
- **Archetypes with shadows** (strength and inherent weakness)
- **Male vs Female** fundamentally different in values, structure, resolution
- **Public/cosmic revelation** (not just personal growth)
- **Outgrow the code** vs change beliefs (deeper transformation)
- **Successive opponents** challenge (use techniques to overcome episodic structure)
- **Symbols always ambiguous** despite established meanings
- **Natural world prominent** (ecological view, humans part of web)

## Examples

**Classic Myths:** Greek (Hercules, Perseus), Norse (Thor, Odin), Epic of Gilgamesh, Ramayana

**Films:** *Lord of the Rings*, *Star Wars*, *Black Panther*, *Avatar*, *Matrix*, *Wizard of Oz*, *Harry Potter*, *Hunger Games*

**Male Myth Examples:** *Lord of the Rings* (Aragorn), *Star Wars*, most superhero films

**Female Myth Examples:** *Wizard of Oz*, *Avatar*, *Arrival*, *Gravity*, *Inside Out*

**Transcendent:** *Black Panther* (origin of character and nation), *2001: A Space Odyssey* (evolution), *Avatar* (ecological)
