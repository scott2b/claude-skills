## What Was Distilled (Generalizable Content Removed)

### 1. Extensive Examples and Case Studies
**Removed**:
- Detailed 5+ page case studies of *Breaking Bad*, *In Bruges*, *The Dark Knight*, *Crime and Punishment*, *Fargo*, *The Usual Suspects*
- Long dialogue excerpts and scene breakdowns
- Multiple examples for each beat

**Preserved**:
- Brief references to key examples
- Essential illustrative examples where needed
- Example titles for reference

**Rationale**: The model has semantic knowledge of these well-known films/shows. Brief triggers activate existing knowledge.

### 2. Verbose Explanations of Known Concepts
**Removed**:
- Lengthy explanations of story structure basics
- Detailed background on Crime vs Detective vs Thriller
- Extensive moral philosophy theory
- Repetitive explanations of the same concept

**Preserved**:
- Concise definitions
- Key distinctions unique to Truby's framework
- Critical principles

**Rationale**: The model understands story structure, genre distinctions, and moral philosophy. Only unique aspects of Truby's Crime framework need detail.

### 3. Redundant Template Sections
**Removed**:
- moral-argument-template.md (redundant with crime-structure-template)
- Verbose prompt questions in templates
- Extensive explanations within templates
- Redundant sections across templates

**Preserved**:
- Essential template structure
- Key sections unique to Crime analysis

**Rationale**: Templates should be concise guides, not verbose instructions. Users understand how to fill them in.

### 4. Background Theory
**Removed**:
- Extended discussion of "Crime Mind-Action Story View"
- Lengthy explanations of moral universe concepts
- Detailed theory of responsibility and choice
- Extensive moral code creation theory

**Preserved**:
- Core concepts with concise definitions
- Key principles (e.g., "Character is destiny")
- Essential distinctions (good vs right)

**Rationale**: The model knows moral philosophy and story theory. Specific terminology triggers the right knowledge domain.

### 5. Procedural Explanations
**Removed**:
- Verbose step-by-step instructions for known procedures
- Extensive "how to" explanations
- Detailed guidance for standard tasks

**Preserved**:
- Unique workflow steps specific to this skill
- Critical procedures not standard in model's knowledge
- File output requirements and validation

**Rationale**: Standard procedures are known; only unique workflow needs detail.

## What Was Preserved (Unique Knowledge Retained)

### 1. Essential Lexical Triggers
**Preserved in full**:
- "Crime is fictional moral philosophy"
- "Moral accounting - what one owes vs what one is owed"
- "Opponent must want SAME goal as hero"

- "Master cop" and "master criminal"
- "Cat and mouse" conflict
- "Obsessive cop technique"
- "Poetic justice" - payment in kind, karmic reckoning
- Specific Crime and Morality beat names and sequence

**Rationale**: These specific terms activate the model's semantic knowledge of Truby's framework.

### 2. Critical Missing Beat Warning
**Preserved in full**:
- Beat 8: Opponent's Plan and Main Counterattack
- "**CRUCIAL AND OFTEN MISSING**"
- "More intricate the plan + better hidden = better the plot"

**Rationale**: This is unique insight crucial to Crime stories that writers commonly miss.

### 3. Unique Procedural Knowledge
**Preserved in full**:
- File output requirement (timestamped documents)
- 11-step task instruction workflow
- Integration with 7-step/22-step foundation
- Crime-specific beat sequence (15 beats)
- Morality beat sequence (8 beats)
- Revelations and moral decisions tracking
- Organic connections assessment
- Validation checklist

**Rationale**: This workflow is unique to this skill and not standard knowledge.

### 4. Key Distinctions
**Preserved in full**:
- Cop hero vs criminal hero
- Standard Crime vs Epic Tragedy vs Black Comedy
- Crime vs Detective vs Thriller (concise)
- Equal ability requirement
- Deception as key technique
- Plot carries moral argument (not heavy-handed)

**Rationale**: These are specific to Truby's Crime framework and differentiate it from other approaches.

### 5. Critical Principles and Techniques
**Preserved**:
- All 11 key techniques (ingenious crime, deception, obsessive cop, etc.)
- All critical principles (character is destiny, freedom = justice, etc.)
- Never-ending moral challenge technique
- Final decision technique
- Poetic justice framework

**Rationale**: These are unique techniques specific to Truby's approach.

### 6. Template Structure
**Preserved**:
- All essential sections of templates
- Crime beats checklist
- Morality beats checklist
- Sequences tracking
- Organic connections assessment
- The Joker Standard comparison (in opponent-plan template)

**Rationale**: Structure is unique to Crime analysis; must be preserved for capability.

## Distillation Strategy Used

### Semantic Activation Approach
The distilled version leverages the model's existing semantic knowledge of:
- John Truby's story structure frameworks (trained on his work)
- Crime genre conventions and tropes
- Well-known films and shows (Breaking Bad, The Dark Knight, etc.)
- Moral philosophy concepts
- Story structure principles

By providing **essential lexical triggers** (specific terminology unique to Truby's Crime framework), the distilled skill activates this latent knowledge without re-teaching known concepts.

### What Makes This Effective
1. **Well-known published framework**: Truby's work is documented and likely in training data
2. **Established genre**: Crime is well-understood genre with known conventions
3. **Famous examples**: Breaking Bad, The Dark Knight, etc. are well-known
4. **Standard concepts**: Moral philosophy, story structure, character arcs are known

### What Remains Detailed
Only information that is:
- **Unique to this specific framework** (Truby's particular beat structure)
- **Procedurally novel** (this skill's specific workflow)
- **Critical and often missed** (opponent's plan emphasis)
- **Truly proprietary** (templates, specific sequences)

## Usage Recommendation

### When to Use Distilled Version
- Default for most Crime story analysis work
- When token efficiency is important
- When user is familiar with story structure concepts
- For quick consultations and references

### When to Use Full Version
- When teaching someone unfamiliar with Truby's work
- When detailed examples are specifically needed
- When extensive case studies would be helpful
- For comprehensive learning/study (vs. working reference)

### Testing Recommendation
Test the distilled version with:
1. New crime story analysis
2. Existing draft with moral argument issues
3. Opponent's plan development
4. Moral code creation

Verify outcomes match what full version would produce.

2. **Preserving unique procedural knowledge** specific to this skill
3. **Keeping critical distinctions** that differentiate Truby's approach
4. **Maintaining essential structure** while removing verbose explanations
5. **Referencing rather than detailing** generalizable content

The distilled skill is production-ready and recommended as the default version for Crime story structure analysis work.
