# Crime Story Steps: Distilled Reference

Concise reference for John Truby's Crime framework from *The Anatomy of Genres* chapter 7.

## Crime Story Overview

**Crime is fictional moral philosophy.** Stories about restoring fairness and justice when fundamental human law is violated.

**Overall strategy**: Pit criminal who thinks he's above society against defender of society's rules and values.

**Key distinction**: Crime emphasizes contest between criminal and lawman (not detection/investigation). Questions whether illegal act is immoral and whether true justice done.

## The Crime Mind-Action View

Life is constant moral accounting. In pursuing desires, we use and harm others. On the ledger, each action recorded with what is owed. In social world, moral accounting must balance. Action must be paid for. If not, conflict.

Balancing books becomes complex when moral action opposes legal action.

## Crime Story Steps (15)

### 1. Story World - Slavery of Superficial Society
Society between two dystopian extremes: no crime (chaos) or police state. Extreme wealth/poverty. Possibility of moving up through work almost gone. People turn to crime.

### 2. Inciting Event - Crime
Criminal commits ingenious crime catapulting to wealth/power. Expression of criminal's brilliance and artistry.

**Technique**: More deception = better Crime story.

### 3. Hero Strengths and Weakness-Need
**Cop**: Regular person, especially good at job (master cop). Lives at deeper level. Strong weakness-need. Doesn't fit society but has stronger faith in it.

**Criminal**: Brilliant, master at beating system. Feels superior enough to live by own rules. Make partially justified if hero.

### 4. Values and Moral Code
**Cop code**: Law holy, must enforce. Brotherhood (won't turn in fellow cop).

**Criminal code**: Honor among thieves (or none). Code of silence (omertà).

Write detailed moral code for hero.

### 5. Desire
**Cop**: Catch a criminal (different from Detective's "find truth"). Crime blends Detective and Action.

**Criminal**: Money, power, win game, prove superiority.

### 6. Opponent/Mystery - Super Criminal
Criminal or cop. Usually brilliant, master at beating system. Feels superior. **Must want SAME goal as hero.**

Mirror image on either side of law. **Both must be equally matched—best at their jobs.**

### 7. Drive - Cat and Mouse
Series of conflicts matching wits and force. One-on-one, master vs master.

**Technique - Obsessive Cop**: Show cop going too far, acting like criminal. Explores thin line between inside/outside law.

### 8. Opponent's Plan and Main Counterattack
**CRUCIAL AND OFTEN MISSING.** Opponent's strategy, hidden attacks, main counterattack.

**KEY POINT**: More intricate the plan + better hidden = better the plot.

**Technique - Deceptive Attack**: Both sides use deception, hide overall campaign.

### 9. Revelation - Criminal Uncovered
Trickery criminal uses to escape cop. Criminal as artist of crime. Hidden attacks causing most trouble.

### 10. Drive - Moral Argument
Crime emphasizes moral argument—immoral/illegal actions hero takes to win. Express through plot, not heavy-handed theme.

**Plot pattern**: Illegal act → another to cover up → tighter moral bind → mistake → repeat.

### 11. Apparent Defeat - Criminal Escapes
Criminal escapes or wins major victory. Hero believes they've lost.

### 12. Gate-Gauntlet-Visit to Death - Chase
Crime version often big chase. Cat and mouse at top speed. Pressure unbearable, space constricts, options narrow.

### 13. Violent Battle or Big Revelation
Final confrontation or big reveal. **In transcendent Crime, big reveal** moves toward Detective. Closer reveal to end = better.

**Technique - Final Reveal**: Plan at beginning. Make each part of opponent's interconnected campaign.

### 14. Self-Revelation - Society Reaffirmed
**Normal**: Cop reaffirms values of living in society/within law.

**Negative**: Society loses. Criminal wins. Artist beats system (Pyrrhic victory—alone).

**Mixed**: Society reaffirmed through lying/complex outcome.

### 15. Moral Argument Conclusion - Poetic Justice
Criminal punished, law upheld. But justice system doesn't necessarily produce justice. Laws = rough estimate of moral accounting.

**Poetic Justice**: Payment in kind, payment unique to crime, karmic reckoning, by offender's own hand.

**"Eye for an eye"**: Not just punishment fits crime—symbol of desire to close wound, equal books.

## Morality Story Steps (8) - For Transcendent Crime

### 1. Story World - Moral Universe
All actions have moral consequences. Moral universe depends on how it defines **responsibility** and **choice**.

**Character is destiny** (Heraclitus): We are responsible for results of our life and moral effects on others. Future determined by quality of character, not fate/destiny.

**Choice**: Without choice, no responsibility, no morality. Once willing to take responsibility, we have choice.

**Technique - Never-Ending Moral Challenge**: Set up moral universe constantly testing moral fiber of every character. Each episode has unique moral challenge.

### 2. Character Web - Moral Code
Hero has detailed moral code guiding actions. Balance freedom to pursue desire vs freedom of others not to be harmed.

**KEY POINT**: How much values about self vs how much care about effect on others?

**Technique - Executing Moral Code**: Embed over plot in 3 places:
1. Values present from beginning
2. Middle: right/wrong actions trying to get goal
3. Final moral decision determines if moved to higher level

### 3. Opposition - The Good vs The Right
**Internal opposition in moral code**:
- **The Good** (ends): What individual values, improves state of being
- **The Right** (means): Balance between entities. Wrong action harms others.

Central question: Should individual put right above good, others above self?

### 4. Plan - Values and Right/Wrong Action
Moral code = game plan for how to win only desirable goals using only proper actions.

Two activities:
1. Assessing what makes goal valuable
2. Assessing right/wrong actions to reach goal

### 5. Drive - Assessing Ends vs Means
Hero desperate, takes immoral actions. Human being questions own means, denies self an end.

**Freedom vs Justice**: Justice optimizes freedom for everyone.

**Story Code**: Tracks human chasing value (the good) using questionable means (the right).

### 6. Attack by Ally - Shame and Guilt
Ally attacks hero for immoral actions. Hero justifies. Attack from without and within (shame/guilt).

**KEY POINT**: When individual attacks self through shame/guilt, never enough.

### 7. Battle, Moral Self-Revelation, and Moral Decision
**Moral Self-Revelation**: Sees effect of actions on others. "I have wronged them. Must make amends."

**Moral Decision**: Funnel to single decision between two choices.

**KEY POINT**: Must have 2 elements—(1) affect others, (2) personal sacrifice either way.

### 8. Thematic Revelation
Moral code rises to higher understanding. No longer limited to one individual, becomes guideline for all.

May involve poetic justice (payment appropriate to crime).

## Creating a Moral Code

### The Ten Commandments
Most influential moral code in story. Dual purpose: 5 proper desires (ends), 5 proper actions (means).

### The Existential Code
Individual is what they do. Free to choose, responsible for consequences. "Character is destiny."

Framework: "Choice up to you. Define moral code. That's part of identity."

### Other Classic Codes
- **Chivalric Code**: Honor, courage, service, faith
- **Bushido**: JIN (compassion), MAKOTO (sincerity), CHUGI (loyalty), MEIYO (honor), YU (valor), REI (courtesy), GI (rectitude)
- **Code of the West**: Independence, freedom, self-reliance, courage, honesty
- **Detective Code**: Knight in city, jaded but soldiers on for good

## Transcendent Crime

### Epic Crime Tragedy
Master criminal hero with extraordinary intelligence wastes greatness proving superiority. Lost potential. Moral accounting over lifetime. What one owes vs is owed, life-or-death stakes.

Tragedy highlights difficulty of re-creating better moral system. Morality rigid, resistant to change.

**Examples**: *Crime and Punishment*, *The Dark Knight*, *The Wire*, *Atonement*

### Crime Black Comedy
Moral code as destructive system. Extreme passion + lack of knowledge = deadly world. Downward cycle where even love kills. Playing out of karma through comedy of errors.

**Examples**: *Breaking Bad*, *In Bruges*, *Fargo*, *No Country for Old Men*, *Parasite*

#### Breaking Bad
Serial structure: Episodes build to season finales. Plot determined by sequence of hero's moral decisions (progressively worse). "How far can we push hero toward darkness and not lose audience?"

Walter White: Normal man → Mr. Chips → Scarface. Plot comes from character.

#### In Bruges
Twisted but logical moral code of professional killers. Poetic justice masterclass—Harry must follow own stated code.

**KEY POINT**: To execute big moral decision at end, character must clearly express moral code early.

## Key Techniques

1. **Ingenious Crime**: Expression of criminal's brilliance and artistry
2. **Deception**: More deception = better Crime story
3. **Obsessive Cop**: Cop goes too far, acts like criminal
4. **Criminal Partially Justified**: Makes criminal hero complex, cop torn
5. **Opponent's Plan**: Most often missing. More intricate + hidden = better
6. **Deceptive Attack**: Both sides use deception, hide campaigns
7. **Plot Carries Moral Argument**: Through action, not statement
8. **Final Reveal**: Plan early. Push close to end
9. **Never-Ending Moral Challenge**: Constantly test moral fiber
10. **Final Decision**: Funnel to single choice between two
11. **Poetic Justice**: Payment in kind, unique to crime, by own hand

## Visual Shape
**Linear**: Single goal, one main opponent, intensity. (Standard Crime)

**Branching**: Multiple heroes in Social Drama subgenres.

## Crime vs Other Genres
- **Detective/Thriller**: Finding truth through investigation
- **Crime**: Contest between criminal and lawman; questions if illegal = immoral
- **Action**: Individual, superiority, rising to top
- **Crime**: Society, equality, no one takes advantage
