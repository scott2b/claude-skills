# Story Structure: Myth Genre

**PRIMARY DELIVERABLE: This skill creates timestamped reference documents saved to files.**

This skill helps writers analyze and develop mythic story structure using John Truby's framework from *The Anatomy of Genres* chapter 4. Myth is the essential mind in story form, the first Story Code that consciousness constructs. It tracks the development of the self over a lifetime through a physical journey that manifests inner change.

## Critical: File Output is MANDATORY

**This skill MUST save analysis to a timestamped file.** Conversational output alone is an incomplete task.

Writers need persistent artifacts they can:
- Reference throughout the drafting process
- Update as the story evolves
- Share with collaborators
- Compare with future iterations

**Success = A dated file exists (e.g., `2025-12-16-story-name-myth-structure.md`)**
**Failure = Only conversational output with no saved file**

## Purpose

Myth is the first genre to place the self within the larger society, giving a full picture of culture while highlighting the politics of the human world—within the family, tribe, and nation. The Myth form helps writers create detailed story worlds readers want to visit again and again, develop character change through external journey that manifests internal journey, build the Great Chain of Being (hierarchy of characters from gods to minerals), master the symbolic language of myth (talismans, journeys, natural world), track the hero's search for their destiny and immortality, distinguish between Male Myth (divide and conquer) and Female Myth (combine and grow), and transcend into Creation Myths, Female Myths, or Ecological Myths.

## When to Invoke This Skill

Invoke this skill when writers are creating:
- Epic journeys where the hero must discover who they were born to be
- Stories with elaborate world-building (fantasy, science fiction, superhero)
- Narratives tracking the life process from birth to death to rebirth
- Character arcs about finding one's place in the natural order
- Stories exploring immortality, destiny, and self-questioning
- Myths involving gods, supernatural beings, or the Great Chain of Being
- Female-centered narratives emphasizing growth cycles over linear conquest
- Ecological stories balancing nature and technology
- Creation myths or origin stories for cultures or characters

**Note**: Myth structure layers on top of basic story structure. Writers should have the seven key steps or twenty-two steps established before adding Myth-specific elements. Use **story-structure-7-steps** or **story-structure-22-step** skills first if basic structure is undefined.

## The Myth Mind-Action Story View

Life is a journey in which one's ultimate goal is to understand oneself. Being is self-questioning and a search for my destiny. The Myth form was the first to answer: What does it mean for a human being to be a self-conscious animal?

**Key Point**: The hero encounters opponents on a journey that eventually exposes his or her deeper self, leading to self-revelation and character change.

**Immortality is the central theme**. Myth involves either:
- The immortality of the hero (becoming a god)
- "Natural immortality" through story and legacy
- Tragedy (cutting off life too early, with no rebirth)

## Task Instructions

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps to analyze or develop mythic story structure.

### Step 1: Establish Output Location FIRST

**Before beginning analysis**, establish where the final document will be saved:

**Determine the environment:**
- With access to project directory and file system tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep): Claude Code environment
- With uploaded files or chat without direct project access: Claude Desktop/Web environment

**In Claude Code:**
1. Get current date: `date +%Y-%m-%d`
2. Ask where to save structure analyses (suggest `structure/` or `process/structure/`)
3. Make note of the filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-myth-structure.md`

**In Claude Desktop/Web:**
1. Note that output will be provided as formatted markdown artifact
2. Remind user to save with timestamped filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-myth-structure.md`

This ensures the file creation is not forgotten and sets the proper context.

### Step 2: Understand Story Context

**Understand the story context:**
1. Ask which story to analyze or develop
2. In Claude Code: If not specified, search for story files in the project (narrative drafts, outlines, structure documents, character notes)
3. In Claude Desktop: Ask to describe the story or share existing materials
4. Understand whether this is:
   - A new mythic story idea needing full structure
   - An existing draft with world-building or journey problems
   - A story in development needing mythic layer added
   - A genre diagnosis (determining if Myth is the right genre)

**Genre check**: Confirm this is actually a Myth story. Myth characteristics:
- Hero goes on a physical journey
- Journey is circular (returns home changed)
- Story world and natural world are prominent
- Theme of destiny, immortality, or becoming
- Character types span a hierarchy (not just humans)

### Step 3: Assess Basic Structure Foundation

Before building Myth-specific elements, determine what structural foundation exists:

**Seven-step or twenty-two-step check**: Has the writer established:
- Weakness and need
- Desire (the journey goal)
- Opponent
- Plan
- Battle
- Self-revelation
- New equilibrium

**If basic structure is undefined**: **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** using the **story-structure-7-steps** or **story-structure-22-step** skill FIRST to establish the foundation, then return to layer on Myth-specific elements.

**If basic structure exists**: Proceed to add Myth steps and elements.

**Important**: Myth steps don't replace basic structure—they enhance it with genre-specific requirements.

**Reference**: See `references/myth-steps.md` for how Myth steps relate to general story structure.

### Step 4: Determine Myth Variation

Myth comes in different forms with distinct story steps. Work with the writer to determine which variation fits their story:

**A. Male Myth (Classic Warrior Journey)**
Characteristics:
- Linear plot based on the hunt/quest
- Hero is typically a warrior or searcher
- Emphasis on battles and physical conflict
- Successive opponents met on journey
- Value system: divide and conquer
- Shame culture (reputation, honor)
- Ends with violent battle
- Examples: Hercules, Perseus, *Star Wars*, *The Lord of the Rings* (Aragorn's storyline)

**B. Female Myth (Cyclical Growth)**
Characteristics:
- Circular/cyclical plot based on agricultural cycle and seasons
- Hero emphasizes combining and growing
- Multiple rebirths throughout story
- Value system: combine and grow
- Guilt culture (relationships, responsibility)
- Ends with return home and community restoration
- Examples: *The Wizard of Oz*, *Avatar*, *Arrival*, *Inside Out*

**C. Hybrid Myth (Combining Both)**
- Contains elements of both Male and Female
- Linear journey with cyclical elements
- Examples: *Avatar* (male warrior who transforms through female values), *Black Panther*

**D. Transcendent Myth (Advanced)**
Three major transcendent forms (optional, to be developed after core Myth steps):
1. **Creation Myth / Myth-Science Fiction Epic**: Tracks the development of a culture, worldwide zeitgeist, or Universal Mind
2. **Female Myth** (as primary focus, not just element)
3. **Ecological Myth**: Invasion of natural world by technological force, seeking balance

Ask the writer which variation best fits their story vision. This will determine which steps to emphasize.

**Reference**: See `references/myth-steps.md` for detailed explanation of Male vs Female Myth.

### Step 5: Build Story World (THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT)

**Key Point**: The story world is the most important major story element in the Myth form. It is the key feature in all world-building genres.

The story world is strongly connected to the natural world (forests, islands, oceans, jungles, ice, deserts, rivers) and typically shows two cultures in contrast.

**Work through the seven steps of story world creation:**

#### Step 5.1: Define the Overall Story Arena

**Questions:**
- What is the unified place surrounded by some kind of wall/boundary?
- What gives the arena unity and distinctiveness?
- What subworlds exist within the arena?
- How do the subworlds provide diversity while maintaining unity?

**Examples**:
- *The Lord of the Rings*: Middle Earth
- *The Wizard of Oz*: Oz surrounded by Deadly Desert, with Kansas as second arena
- *Avatar*: Pandora

#### Step 5.2: Determine Land-People-Technology Interaction

**Key Point**: A story world is the product of a unique combination of three major structural elements: land (natural settings), people (society, culture, man-made spaces), and technology (tools).

**Questions:**
- **LAND**: What natural settings dominate (forests, rivers, mountains, deserts, oceans)?
- **MAN-MADE SPACES**: What structures and spaces have people created (castles, villages, cities)?
- **TECHNOLOGY**: What is the primary tool system (animal, magical, mechanical, digital)?
- How do these three elements combine in a unique way?

#### Step 5.3: Set Up Value Oppositions of Characters

**Key Point**: Any Myth or religion highlights what is most valued by a society. People don't just follow these values; they worship them.

**Questions:**
- What values define the hero's culture?
- What values define the opponent's culture?
- How do these value systems oppose each other?
- What is each side fighting for?

**Example from *The Lord of the Rings***:
- VALUES/Culture of the Good: caring for living things, love, sacrifice
- VS.
- VALUES/Culture of Evil: love of power, dominating living things, obsession with the Ring

#### Step 5.4: Create Subworlds Based on Value Oppositions

**Key Point**: The characters do not exist in service of the world. The world exists in service of the characters and, more specifically, the values they fight over.

**Create subworlds representing**:
1. **Utopia (Heaven on Earth / World of Freedom)**: Land, people, and technology in balance/harmony
   - Community where individuals can grow
   - In structure terms: success, fulfillment, hero's rise
   - Positive character change

2. **Dystopia (Hell on Earth / World of Slavery)**: Land, people, and technology out of balance
   - State of nature, harsh predatory world
   - In structure terms: failure, hero's weaknesses, decline/fall
   - Negative character change

**Questions for each subworld:**
- What natural settings embody this subworld?
- What man-made structures represent it?
- How does technology serve or enslave in this space?
- Which characters inhabit or control this subworld?
- What values dominate here?

#### Step 5.5: Define the Social System

**Questions:**
- What hierarchy of power organizes the world?
- What are the rules of operation?
- What is the deeper system that controls the world?
- How does the culture justify the system?

**Key Point**: The system is what traps the individual. The culture is how the system justifies itself and convinces the individual to accept their place in it.

**Example from *The Lord of the Rings***:
- VALUES: good vs. evil, love vs. power
- LEVELS OF POWER: god, wizard, human, hobbit
- VARIOUS SPECIES: human, hobbit, elf, dwarf, orc, Ent, ghost

#### Step 5.6: Define Technology and Magic System

**Technology**: What are the primary tools by which beings magnify their power over the world?

**Magic System** (if applicable):
- What are the magic powers?
- Who has them?
- What are the limits to the powers?
- Can someone else get them and, if so, how?
- Are any powers limited to a location?
- Can the powers be terminated?

**Key Point**: The more magic power a character has, the less vulnerable they are to defeat and the less useful they are to you in the story.

#### Step 5.7: Determine Overall Development of the World

**Key Point**: Because most stories go from slavery to freedom, begin by showing a world of slavery.

**Key Point**: The world of slavery is an expression of your hero's great weakness. This weakness mirrors the operating principle on which the entire system is based.

**Questions:**
- What is oppressive about the world at the beginning?
- How does the world exacerbate the hero's weakness?
- How will the world change by the end?
- Will utopia be achieved, restored, or revealed as impossible?

**Use template**: Offer to create detailed story world document using `assets/story-world-template.md`.

**Reference**: See `references/myth-steps.md` Story World section for detailed examples.

### Step 6: Create Character Web

Myth requires designing a hierarchy of beings. Work through these elements:

#### Step 6.1: Build Your Great Chain of Being

The Great Chain of Being is a hierarchy by which all "characters" in the world relate and differentiate themselves.

**Traditional hierarchy**:
1. Gods
2. Angels
3. Demons
4. Superheroes
5. Heroes
6. Kings and Queens
7. Nobles
8. Commoners
9. Animals
10. Plants
11. Minerals
12. Nonbeing

**Key Point**: An original Myth story doesn't require all character types. But it does require a character web with a detailed hierarchy that places humans within the natural world.

**Questions:**
- What levels of being exist in your story world?
- What supernatural characters exist (gods, angels, demons, spirits)?
- What enhanced humans exist (superheroes, wizards, chosen ones)?
- What human levels of power exist (kings, nobles, commoners)?
- What non-human beings exist (animals, plants, magical creatures)?
- How do these levels relate to one another?

**Technique: Connecting the Great Chain to Society**
Once you create your character web, connect it with a society that is either heaven or hell, utopia or dystopia.

#### Step 6.2: Define Character Archetypes

Myth deals in broad types of characters known as archetypes. Each archetype has an essential strength and a "shadow" (deep weakness inherent to that role).

**Major Myth archetypes** (select those relevant to your story):

**1. Warrior**
- Strength: practical enforcer of what is right
- Weakness: believes in "kill or be killed," whatever is weak must be destroyed
- Examples: Hercules, Achilles, Luke Skywalker, Katniss Everdeen

**2. Searcher**
- Strength: committed to questioning and self-improvement
- Weakness: can be purposeless and uncommitted
- Examples: knights seeking Holy Grail, Jason seeking Golden Fleece

**3. Teacher**
- Strength: spreads knowledge so people can live better lives
- Weakness: can force students to think a certain way or glorify himself/herself
- Examples: Yoda, Gandalf, Mary Poppins

**4. Rebel**
- Strength: takes action against enslaving system
- Weakness: often doesn't provide better alternative; usually heroic but negative
- Examples: Prometheus, Neo (*The Matrix*), Tris (*Divergent*)

**5. Trickster**
- Strength: attacks oppressive system and defeats unjust people in power
- Weakness: lies, cheats, and steals to get what he/she wants
- Examples: Odysseus, Hermes, Loki, Ferris Bueller

**For each major character, determine:**
- Which archetype do they embody?
- What is their essential strength?
- What is their shadow (weakness)?
- How does this archetype's strength/weakness drive their actions?

#### Step 6.3: Identify the Myth Hero Type

**Key Point**: The basic role of the hero in Myth is the searcher. The Myth hero's search almost always takes them on a dangerous physical journey in which they must fight their way through the world.

**Questions:**
- Is the hero primarily a warrior, searcher, teacher, rebel, or trickster?
- What twist on the archetype makes this hero unique?
- Is this a traditional hero or an underdog variation (like hobbits)?

**Use template**: Offer to create detailed character web document using `assets/character-web-template.md`.

**Reference**: See `references/myth-steps.md` Character Web section for all archetypes.

### Step 7: Work Through Myth-Specific Story Steps

Now layer the Myth steps onto the basic story structure. Consult `references/myth-steps.md` for detailed explanation of each step.

#### Myth Step 1: Ghost—Difficult Birth and Losing the Father

**Questions:**
- Does the story begin with the birth of the hero?
- Is it a difficult birth?
- Does the hero lose their father (or mother in Female Myth)?
- What wound from the past still haunts the hero?

**Modern technique: Rebirth of the Hero**
In more modern Myth stories, begin with the rebirth of the hero rather than literal birth. This allows quicker story start.
- Examples: *Avatar*, *Batman Begins*, *The Matrix*

**How/when does rebirth occur in your story?**

#### Myth Step 2: Weakness-Need—Becoming a Hero

**Key Point**: The weakness-need of the Myth hero is often based on loss of the father. The hero tries to live up to expectations of an ideal father. In other words, the hero needs to become a hero.

**Key Point**: Becoming a hero is a need, not a specific, conscious desire.

**Questions:**
- What does "becoming a hero" mean for this particular character?
- What prevents them from seeing themselves as heroic?
- How does the world of slavery reflect this weakness?

#### Myth Step 3: Inciting Event—Talisman

The hero gains a talisman with two essential features:
1. No one, including the hero, knows the true power of this object
2. It is the physical expression of some major aspect of the hero's identity

**Questions:**
- What talisman does the hero gain?
- Is it a traditional object (sword, shield, cloak, ring)?
- Is it a less traditional object (shoes, seeds, medallion)?
- What is its apparent power?
- What is its true power (revealed later)?
- How does it express the hero's identity/destiny?

**For Male Myth**: Often a sword (right action, enforcement)
**For Female Myth**: Often non-violent object (ruby slippers, seeds, connection)

#### Myth Step 4: Desire—Journey and Destiny

**Technique: External = Internal Journey**
Make the hero's physical journey a physical manifestation of their internal journey.

**Questions:**
- What is the hero's conscious goal?
- What specific end point drives the journey?
- How is this goal embedded within the hero (what they were born to do)?
- How does the goal connect to the hero's internal need?
- Why is this their destiny?

**Key Point**: The central irony of Myth—the hero must go on a long, physical journey to uncover qualities they possessed all along.

**Visual Shape of Plot: Meander**
- Myth uses a meandering, winding path without apparent direction
- One hero, easy-going narrative line, many opponents met in succession
- Plot comes from encountering new opponents at different levels of society

**Questions:**
- What is the journey path?
- What are the major stopping points?
- How does the path eventually lead home (circular)?

#### Myth Step 5: Allies—Including Wise Old Man/Woman

**Questions for each ally:**
- Who helps the hero on the journey?
- Do allies have their own desire lines?
- Is there a Wise Old Man or Wise Old Woman (Teacher archetype)?
- What does the ally lack (brain, heart, courage) that the journey reveals they always had?
- How do allies define the hero through comparison?

**For Female Myth**: Allies are particularly important and may be non-traditional (not warriors)

#### Myth Step 6: Opponent—Successive Strangers

Due to the journey form, Myth opponents tend to be strangers who appear in succession.

**Challenge**: This creates episodic structure where individual scenes stand out but don't connect.

**Technique: Each Opponent and Self-Revelation**
Each opponent should represent an aspect of what the hero must overcome in themselves. Each time the hero defeats an opponent, they may have a minor self-revelation.

**Key Point**: In Myth, nothing is a matter of chance. Each opponent serves the purpose of challenging the hero at their weakest point.

**Best Opponent Technique: Family Trip**
To overcome episodic structure, have the hero take the family along for the ride. This gives ongoing, intimate opponents (family members) along with episodic opponents.

**Technique: The Ongoing Main Opponent**
Try to have at least one opponent present throughout the story, and make that the main opponent.

**Questions:**
- Who is the main opponent present throughout?
- What successive opponents appear along the journey?
- How does each opponent challenge a different aspect of the hero's weakness?
- Is there a hierarchy of opponents with alliances (iceberg opponent)?
- Do any family members come along to provide ongoing conflict?

#### Myth Step 7: Drive—Symbolic Objects

**Key Point**: External symbols always mean something within the hero. Like religion, Myth uses metaphors: symbols with established meaning.

**Symbolic categories to track:**

**Symbolic Characters:**
- Animals (horse, bird, snake): models on path to enlightenment or hell
- Machine: superhuman, efficient but without heart and creativity
- Devil: anti-God, temptation of sin, worst in humankind

**Symbolic Paths:**
- The journey: the life path and life span
- Labyrinth: belly of the beast (death), or confusion en route to enlightenment
- Ladder: stages to enlightenment

**Symbolic Objects:**
- Tree: of life and knowledge
- Cross: tree on which humanity is reborn
- Shadow: the dark side, but potentially source of growth
- Talismans (sword, bow, shield, cloak, seed): right action

**Symbolic Places:**
- Underworld: death and unexplored region of the self
- Garden: being at one with natural law, harmony

**Questions:**
- What symbolic objects appear in the journey?
- What do they mean within the hero's journey?
- How do symbols connect to the natural world?
- What is the symbolic meaning of each major location?

**Key Point**: Even with highly metaphorical symbols, their meaning is not fixed. Symbols are always ambiguous and depend on context.

#### Myth Step 8: Revelation—Opponents Attack

Over the journey, the hero encounters opponents who attack in different ways.

**Questions:**
- What revelation does the hero have about each opponent's method of attack?
- What unique plan does the hero devise to win each battle?
- Does the hero have mini self-revelations about their own capabilities?
- Do revelations build in intensity?

#### Myth Step 9: Gate, Gauntlet, Visit to the Underworld

**Gate/Gauntlet:**
- How does conflict intensify to unbearable pressure?
- Does the hero pass through a narrow passage while assaulted?
- How do the hero's options narrow?

**Visit to Underworld:**
- How does the hero find their way into the underworld (land of the dead)?
- What ancestors or future self does the hero see?
- What part of the self is not examined?
- How does this spur the hero to act and make a narrow escape?

**Note**: In Female Myth, this may be more about facing mortality than literal underworld.

#### Myth Step 10: Battle—Violent or Values

**For Male Myth:**
At the end of the journey, the male warrior hero enters a big, bloody final battle. The stakes are epic. The hero defeats their greatest opponent, but may also die in the process.

**For Female Myth:**
The battle may not be violent at all. It may be about resourcefulness, problem-solving, or choosing a different path than violence.

**Questions:**
- What is the final confrontation?
- For Male Myth: How violent and epic is the battle?
- For Female Myth: How does the hero solve the problem without traditional combat?
- What values are fighting (not just who is stronger)?
- Who wins the goal?

**Example**: *The Wizard of Oz*—Dorothy doesn't wield a sword; she accidentally defeats the Witch with water while trying to save her friend.

#### Myth Step 11: Self-Revelation—Public/Cosmic Revelation

The hero's self-revelation in Myth is not just personal. It takes two forms:

**1. Public Revelation:**
The hero learns they are a king/queen or chosen leader. The deeper import: the hero understands they have special responsibility to lead the community. The health of the kingdom depends on the quality of the king.

**Questions:**
- What does the hero learn about their identity?
- How does this revelation connect to their community/society?
- What responsibility comes with this knowledge?
- Is the hero the "Chosen One"? If so, what is their role?

**2. Cosmic Revelation:**
The hero gains a moral vision or epiphany of how an entire society should exist in the world.

**Questions:**
- What moral vision does the hero gain?
- What code or law could express this vision?
- How does this apply beyond just the hero's personal growth?
- What does the hero understand about the natural order?

**Key Point**: A cosmic vision must be detailed to have meaning to the audience.

**Examples**:
- Moses receiving the Ten Commandments
- Jesus's Sermon on the Mount
- Jake Sully's vision at the Tree of Souls in *Avatar*

#### Myth Step 12: New Equilibrium—Outgrow the Code

The hero returns home profoundly changed by their experience. Often they marry or remarry.

**Instead of changing beliefs of the code they lived by, the hero has outgrown the code entirely.** They are reborn, spiritually and often literally.

**In spiritual rebirth:**
- They see the world and act in a new way
- They are in tune with their destiny and the larger forces of nature

**Questions:**
- How does the hero return home?
- What has fundamentally changed?
- Has the hero married/remarried (symbol of community restoration)?
- How does the hero see the world differently?
- What destiny are they now in tune with?
- Is this a return to the same home, or a new home?

**For Female Myth**: Often emphasizes re-creating community and appreciating family.

**Reference**: See `references/myth-steps.md` for detailed examples of each step.

### Step 8: Develop Journey Structure

Track the journey as a specific map:

#### Step 8.1: Map the Journey Path

**Questions:**
- Where does the journey begin (home)?
- What is the goal destination?
- What are the major stops along the way?
- Does the path eventually lead home (circular)?
- How long is the journey (in story time)?

#### Step 8.2: Track Subworlds Visited

**For each major stop:**
- What subworld is this (utopia, dystopia, in-between)?
- What natural setting dominates?
- What man-made structures exist?
- What values dominate here?
- Who rules this subworld?
- What does the hero learn here?

#### Step 8.3: Track Revelations Along Journey

**Create a revelations sequence**:
1. List all major revelations in order
2. Note what the hero learns at each stop
3. Assess if revelations build in intensity
4. Ensure revelations increase in pace toward the end

**Target**: 7-10 major revelations for average Myth story; more for complex epics.

**Use template**: Offer to create journey map using `assets/journey-map-template.md`.

### Step 9: Assess Transcendent Possibilities (Optional Advanced)

If the writer wants to transcend basic Myth into more ambitious forms, explore these options:

#### Option 1: Creation Myth / Myth-Science Fiction Epic

**Characteristics:**
- Tracks the development of a culture, not just individual
- Creates the consciousness and culture of a people
- May track evolutionary stages
- Provides origin for nation, world, or species

**Questions:**
- Is this an origin story for a character or culture?
- What stages of development does the story track?
- How does individual growth mirror cultural growth?
- What moral code emerges for the society?

**Examples**: *Black Panther* (origin of character and nation), *2001: A Space Odyssey* (evolution of humanity), Genesis (Old Testament)

#### Option 2: Female Myth (As Primary Focus)

**Characteristics:**
- Story world dominated by female characters
- Good witches as well as evil (celebrating female power)
- Multiple rebirths throughout
- Values: self-reliance, resourcefulness, imagination, brains, heart, courage
- Allies are non-traditional (not warriors)
- Main male ally may be revealed as fake/weak
- Battle is non-violent problem-solving
- Emphasis on combine and grow over divide and conquer

**Questions:**
- How many rebirths does the hero experience?
- What is the role of male characters (allies, weak wizards, transformed warriors)?
- How does the hero solve problems without violence?
- What does "combine and grow" mean in this specific story?

**Examples**: *The Wizard of Oz*, *Avatar*, *Arrival*, *Gravity*, *Inside Out*

#### Option 3: Ecological Myth

**Characteristics:**
- Tracks invasion of natural world by technological force
- Hero changes from technological to natural human being
- Goes backward in time: culturally (city to pastoral) and personally (adult to child)
- Final rebirth: hero becomes new kind of person combining nature and technology
- Establishes harmony between city and nature
- Marriage of science and myth

**Negative version: Machine in the Garden**
- Hero tries to defend nature but loses
- Machine destroys the garden
- City and nature remain unconnected

**Questions:**
- How does technology threaten the natural world?
- How does the hero transform from technological to natural being?
- What multiple rebirths occur?
- Is final state a balance or a defeat?
- How does the hero bring insights from nature to city (or vice versa)?

**Examples**: *Avatar* (positive), *Dances with Wolves*, many Thomas Hardy novels

**Reference**: See `references/myth-steps.md` "Transcending Myth" section for detailed guidance.

### Step 10: Assess Organic Connections

Verify that Myth elements connect organically with basic structure:

**Connection tests:**
- **Story World ↔ Weakness**: Does the world express and exacerbate the hero's weakness?
- **Talisman ↔ Identity**: Does the talisman express the hero's true identity?
- **Journey ↔ Internal Change**: Does the physical journey manifest internal change?
- **Opponents ↔ Weakness**: Does each opponent challenge a different aspect of the hero's weakness?
- **Symbols ↔ Theme**: Do symbolic objects connect to the theme of destiny/immortality?
- **Self-Revelation ↔ Community**: Is the revelation both personal and public/cosmic?
- **New Equilibrium ↔ Rebirth**: Has the hero been spiritually reborn, not just changed?

**Identify weak connections** and suggest how to strengthen them.

### Step 11: Provide Structural Analysis and Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

**For new mythic stories:**
- Is story world detailed enough (most important element)?
- Is character web established (Great Chain of Being)?
- Are Myth steps present and connected?
- Is journey structure clear?
- Are symbolic objects/places identified?
- Is this Male, Female, or Hybrid Myth?
- Are transcendent possibilities appropriate?

**For existing drafts:**
- Which Myth steps are present and working well?
- Which steps are missing or underdeveloped?
- Is story world sufficiently immersive?
- Is the journey episodic or does it build?
- Are symbolic elements consistent?
- What revisions would strengthen mythic structure?

**For genre diagnosis:**
- Is this truly a Myth story or another genre?
- Which Myth variation does it fit (Male/Female/Hybrid)?
- What would make the mythic elements stronger?

### Step 12: Save Structure Documentation (REQUIRED)

**MANDATORY: Do not consider the task complete until file is saved.**

**If in Claude Code (project directory access):**
1. Create the chosen directory if it doesn't exist using Bash (e.g., `mkdir -p structure`)
2. Use Write tool to save file with the filename established in Step 1: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-myth-structure.md`
3. Use the structure format from `assets/myth-structure-template.md`
4. Include complete analysis from Steps 5-11
5. Offer to create supplementary documents:
   - Story world detail: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-story-world.md` using `assets/story-world-template.md`
   - Character web detail: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-character-web.md` using `assets/character-web-template.md`
   - Journey map: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-journey-map.md` using `assets/journey-map-template.md`
6. Confirm save location to user with full file path

**Validation Checklist - Before Completing:**
- [ ] Date obtained via Bash in Step 1
- [ ] Save location confirmed with user in Step 1
- [ ] Analysis completed in Steps 2-11
- [ ] File written using Write tool
- [ ] File path confirmed to user
- [ ] Supplementary documents offered

**If in Claude Desktop/Web (no project directory):**
1. Create the analysis as a formatted markdown artifact
2. Present it in the chat for review
3. Remind user to save with timestamped filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-[story-name]-myth-structure.md`
4. Use the structure format from `assets/myth-structure-template.md`
5. Offer to create supplementary documents separately
6. Offer to explore any specific Myth element in more depth if requested

**If any Claude Code checklist item is unchecked, the task is incomplete.**

## Important Reminders

- **Story World is paramount**: The story world is the most important element in Myth. Spend the most time here.
- **Layer on basic structure**: Myth steps enhance seven steps or twenty-two steps, they don't replace them.
- **Male vs Female matters**: The distinction between Male and Female Myth affects almost every step.
- **Great Chain of Being**: Create a hierarchy of beings, not just human characters.
- **Physical = Internal**: The physical journey must manifest the internal journey.
- **Circular journey**: Most Myths are circular—hero returns home to discover what was always within.
- **Symbolic language**: Everything in Myth has symbolic meaning connected to the hero's internal state.
- **Immortality theme**: Theme of immortality, destiny, and legacy runs through all Myth stories.
- **Not all rebirths are literal**: Rebirth can be cultural, spiritual, or metaphorical.
- **Opponents challenge weaknesses**: Each opponent should target a different aspect of the hero's weakness.
- **Public and cosmic**: Myth self-revelation is both personal and larger than personal.
- **Avoid episodic structure**: Use family trip or ongoing main opponent to prevent episodic meander.

**Reference**: See `references/myth-steps.md` for all detailed principles, examples, and techniques.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Replace the writer's creative vision or mythological instincts
- Guarantee a "good" Myth story (execution still matters)
- Work for non-journey stories (Myth requires physical journey)
- Provide scene-by-scene dialogue or prose (it establishes structural foundation)
- Eliminate the need for other story elements (theme, symbol, scene work)
- Work as a mechanical formula (must be adapted to unique story)
- Replace basic story structure (must be layered on top of seven steps or twenty-two steps)

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works alongside:
- **story-structure-7-steps** - Establishes basic foundation; Myth builds on it
- **story-structure-22-step** - For complex Myth stories, use 22 steps first
- **symbol-web** - Deepens the symbolic elements inherent in Myth
- **narrative-inventory** - Catalogues what exists; Myth skill shows if genre elements are present
- **narrative-keywords** - Identifies themes of destiny, immortality, becoming
- **narrative-maps** - Shows spatial structure of the journey
- Character development tools
- World-building tools
- Genre-specific tools
