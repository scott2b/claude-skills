# Myth Story Steps: Comprehensive Reference

Based on John Truby's "Myth: The Life Process" from *The Anatomy of Genres*

## Overview: What Is Myth?

Myth is the essential mind in story form, the first Story Code that consciousness constructs. Myth is the shape of basic human consciousness. Therefore, every human being creates Myths in some form to solve life's problems.

**Key Point**: Myth is primarily about the development of the self over a lifetime.

While Myth is usually thought of as an early form of religion, the reverse is true. Religion is a codified form of Myth, and more broadly, a form of art.

**Key Point**: Most religions are a collection of stories designed to lay out a moral code necessary to achieve immortality. Not surprisingly, **immortality is the main theme of the Myth genre**.

## The Myth Mind-Action Story View

The Mind-Action story view is a combination of the genre's worldview and recipe for living a good life. The Myth version of Mind-Action says that **life is a journey in which one's ultimate goal is to understand oneself**.

**Key Point**: Myth is the first genre to answer the essential question: What does it mean for a human being to be a self-conscious animal?

The hero encounters a number of opponents on a journey that eventually exposes his or her deeper self. That is the self-revelation leading to character change.

**Every landmark in the character's outer journey must be a physical manifestation of inner change.** As the first fully realized form to match the hero's external journey with their internal journey, Myth was a major landmark in the history of storytelling.

The physical journey typically ends with the hero returning home. The life journey ends with the hero's inner rebirth.

## Myth Story Step 1: Story World—Natural World and Two Cultures

**The story world is the most important major story element in the Myth form.** It is the key feature in all "world-building" genres, including Fantasy and Science Fiction.

Why? The reader gets to immerse herself in the world and explore all the fabulous things within it. This requires the writer to create a detailed world the reader wants to visit again and again, and never leave.

In all world-building stories, especially Myth, the story world is strongly connected to the natural world, such as forests, islands, oceans, jungles, ice, deserts, and rivers. This connection comes out of the deeper themes of Myth that express an ecological view of the world. The forces of connection in the natural world are palpable, and humans are part of that natural web.

Myth stories also connect the hero with the kingdom: he/she starts in one kingdom and journeys through another kingdom before returning home. This creates a contrast between the two cultures the story explores.

At the beginning of the Myth story, the hero typically lives in an oppressive or conformist society-culture. Often, the current king is a tyrant. The hero's family may pressure him to follow in his father's footsteps, even when the father is gone. This story world exacerbates the hero's weakness-need.

**Key Point**: The two cultures depicted in the Myth story world are usually opposites in some way.

### The Seven Steps for Creating the Story World

#### Step 1. Define the Overall Story Arena

The arena is a unified place surrounded by some kind of wall.

**Example: The Lord of the Rings**
J. R. R. Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings* is a modern cosmology and mythology of Great Britain. Sources include Greek and Norse mythology, Christianity, the fairy tale, the legend of King Arthur, and other tales of the knight-errant.

The main reason for the huge success of *The Lord of the Rings* is its magnificent story world, Middle Earth. The story plays out in a large but defined place with seemingly infinite subworlds. This gives the story two strengths: (1) unity and distinctiveness, and (2) diversity and additional subplots stemming from the subworlds.

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
*The Wizard of Oz* is primarily a Fantasy in which the heroine enters a magical world through a passageway and then returns home changed from the experience. But it is also a Female Myth.

The story is really two myths. The first takes place on a farm in the harsh black-and-white world of Kansas. After being sucked up in a cyclone, Dorothy enters the magical land of Oz and plays out a longer Myth.

This structure gives the story two arenas: Dorothy's farm in Kansas, and Oz, a land surrounded by the Deadly Desert.

#### Step 2. Determine the World's Unique Interaction of Land, People, and Technology

**Key Point**: A story world is the product of a unique combination of three major structural elements: land (natural settings), people (society, culture, and man-made spaces), and technology (tools).

**Example: The Lord of the Rings**
The combination of land-people-technology is a throwback to King Arthur and the Middle Ages:
- **LAND**: lush nature, emphasizing forests, rivers, and mountains
- **MAN-MADE SPACES**: castles and villages
- **TECHNOLOGY**: animal and magical

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
The combination is a hybrid of nineteenth-century American farms and cities with eighteenth-century European castles:
- **LAND**: the bare plains of Kansas, the Fighting Trees in Quadling Country, poppy fields, and mountains, all surrounded by desert
- **MAN-MADE SPACES**: Dorothy's farm, the village of Munchkinland, the Wicked Witch's castle, and the Emerald City
- **TECHNOLOGY**: animal and magical

#### Step 3. Set Up the Value Oppositions of the Characters

**Key Point**: Any Myth or religion highlights what is most valued by a society. People don't just follow these values; they worship them.

Values come in clusters. Each cluster represents the culture of the society. Because story works through a conflict between the hero and opponents, the story world is almost always divided into two competing cultures. It expresses this through:

1. The opposing values of the characters, and, based on that,
2. The opposing subworlds, or visual contrasts.

**Example: The Lord of the Rings**
- **VALUES/Culture of the Good**: caring for living things and love. The highest love takes the form of sacrifice, especially of one's own life for another.
- **VS.**
- **VALUES/Culture of Evil**: love of power, dominating living things, and obsession with the Ring. The Ring symbolizes the desire for false values and absolute power: whoever owns it will become evil and corrupt.

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
- **VALUES/Culture of the Good**: self-reliance, resourcefulness, imagination, brains, heart, and courage.
- **VS.**
- **VALUES/Culture of Evil**: love of power and domination over others.

#### Step 4. Create the Subworlds Based on These Value Oppositions

**Key Point**: The characters do not exist in service of the world. The world exists in service of the characters and, more specifically, the values they fight over. This is the main way we connect world to characters.

The Myth story world sets up major subworlds based on nature. Islands, mountains, forests, jungles, rivers, deserts, ice, and oceans all have an inherent symbolic power. The writer can and should tap into this power when designing the subworlds.

If we push any society/story world to the extremes of freedom and slavery, we get utopia and dystopia.

**UTOPIA (Heaven on Earth / World of Freedom)**
If the three major elements of land, people, and technology are in balance or harmony, the result is a community. Here, individuals can grow in their own way, but also have the support of others to help them when they need it.

In story structure terms, utopia represents:
- Success in reaching the goal
- The fulfillment of the hero's greatest potential
- The hero's rise

In other words, Utopia is an expression of positive character change. It represents the height of character change where all individuals become the best versions of themselves.

**DYSTOPIA (Hell on Earth / World of Slavery)**
If the land, people, and technology are out of balance, everyone is out for themselves. The result is what is known as a "state of nature," a harsh predatory world. Each person is reduced to an animal clawing for scarce resources or a cog working for a large machine.

In story structure terms, dystopia represents:
- The failure, perversion, or opposition of desire
- The hero's or opponents' weaknesses
- The hero's decline or fall

**Example: The Lord of the Rings**
Three different versions of utopia (perfect balance of land, people, and technology, based on love, caring, and living things):
1. **The Shire**: home of the Hobbits, a village embedded in a tamed, agricultural world
2. **Rivendell**: a utopia built around water and plants
3. **Lothlorien**: a beautiful, harmonic forest world

Examples of dystopian subworlds:
- The mountain fortresses of Mordor, Isengard, and Helm's Deep, all founded on raw power and metal
- The underground caverns of Moria in the Misty Mountains (the "underworld")

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
The arena of Oz (in the novel) is divided into four subworlds: the lands of the Munchkins to the east, Quadlings to the south, Winkies to the west, and Gillikins to the north, with the Emerald City at the center.

The Emerald City is a fake utopia. In the original book, it is green only because the Wizard makes the people wear green goggles.

The Wicked Witch's castle represents dystopia. It is a dark prison ruled over by a sadistic witch. The terrifying Flying Monkeys are enslaved by the Wicked Witch and are set free when Dorothy kills her.

#### Step 5. Define the Social System That Organizes the Story World

Besides values, the story world is based on the hierarchy of power and the rules of operation. This is the deeper system that controls the world. The system determines how the individuals act toward one another as they try to be successful within the rules.

**Key Point**: The system is what traps the individual. The culture is how the system justifies itself, and convinces the individual to accept their place in it.

**Example: The Lord of the Rings**
The Middle Earth system is organized by:
- **VALUES**: good versus evil, love versus power
- **LEVELS OF POWER OF DIFFERENT BEINGS**: god, wizard, human, and hobbit
- **VARIOUS SPECIES**: human, hobbit, elf, dwarf, orc (goblin), Ent, and ghost

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
The system is organized by:
- **VALUES**: self-reliance, resourcefulness, imagination, brains, heart, and courage
- **LEVELS OF POWER**: witches, whether good or evil, are most powerful; the Wizard of Oz has no magical power
- **VARIOUS SPECIES AND RACES**: good and bad witches, Munchkins, Flying Monkeys, a wide array of talking animals and other species, and animated objects like the Scarecrow and Tin Woodsman

#### Step 6. Define the Key Technology of the World and the Magic System

Technology refers to the primary tools by which humans magnify their power over the world. The magic system defines how the supernatural elements of the story operate.

**Technique: Magic System**
Be as specific as possible when answering these questions:
- What are the magic powers?
- Who has them?
- What are the limits to the powers?
- Can someone else get them and, if so, how?
- Are any powers limited to a location?
- Can the powers be terminated?

**Key Point**: The more magic power a character has, the less vulnerable they are to defeat and the less useful they are to you in the story.

**Example: The Lord of the Rings**
Uses Middle Ages technology. Mass communication is by fire signals lit on mountaintops. The technology of war is highly detailed: the sword, the horse, and flying reptiles (magical equivalent of fighter planes). For artillery, attacking armies use trebuchets to catapult boulders at castle walls.

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
The technology of magic comes primarily from wands and Dorothy's shoes. For the privileged few, travel is by hot-air balloon and broomstick. But most creatures walk.

#### Step 7. Determine the Overall Development of the World

**Key Point**: Because most stories go from slavery to freedom, begin by showing a world of slavery.

**Key Point**: The world of slavery is an expression of your hero's great weakness. This weakness mirrors the operating principle on which the entire system is based.

## Myth Story Step 2: Ghost—Difficult Birth and Losing the Father

Many Myth stories begin with the birth of the hero. Joseph Campbell points out that it is usually a difficult birth, and soon thereafter, the (male) hero loses his father.

**Technique: Rebirth of the Hero**
In more modern Myth stories, the writer often begins with the rebirth of the hero.

Why? First, it allows the writer to avoid the slow childhood period that delays the onset of the hero's desire line. As a result, the story has a much quicker start.

**Examples**: *Avatar*, *Batman Begins*, and the Science Fiction/Myth story *The Matrix*.

## Myth Story Step 3: Character Web—The Great Chain of Being

Myth is founded on the longest life process in story. It takes two main forms:
1. The hero's journey from birth to death to rebirth
2. The hierarchy of beings in the world

The second form is known as the **Great Chain of Being**, a profound and influential typology of the world that goes back primarily to Aristotle. From material objects to god, the sequence in the Great Chain of Being is founded on a movement from entities of matter to entities of "spirit."

The Great Chain of Being is really a map of how the human mind creates the outside world through character types.

**Key Point**: The Great Chain of Being is still the technique for creating a compelling story world in the major world-building genres such as Myth, Fantasy, and even Science Fiction.

The Great Chain of Being is a hierarchy by which all "characters" in the world relate and differentiate themselves:

1. Gods
2. Angels
3. Demons
4. Superheroes
5. Heroes
6. Kings and Queens
7. Nobles
8. Commoners
9. Animals
10. Plants
11. Minerals
12. Nonbeing

Notice that this hierarchy has physical entities, different major life-forms, humans at different levels of power in the society, and natural and supernatural characters.

The Great Chain of Being is the opposite of democracy, in which all humans are created equal, and especially from what we would call "ecological democracy," where all beings coexist.

The Great Chain of Being is also a social fractal that applies at every level of society and individual.

To create the character web in a Myth story, you must design your version of the Great Chain of Being.

**Caution**: An original Myth story doesn't require all the character types found in the Chain. But it does require a character web with a detailed hierarchy that places humans within the natural world.

**Technique: Connecting the Great Chain to Society**
Once you create your own character web based on the Great Chain of Being—divine, human, animal, vegetable, mineral—connect it with a society that is either heaven or hell, utopia or dystopia.

## Myth Story Step 4: Character Web—Archetypes

The Myth story form deals in broad types of characters, known as archetypes. Archetypes are defined by their psychological flaws and social roles. They represent a fundamental way of being, as well as a level of being.

An individual character that expresses one of these types has a primary trait and way of living that audiences around the world immediately recognize.

**Key Point**: Each archetype has an essential strength that defines him or her, but also a "shadow." The shadow is the deep weakness inherent to that character's basic role in society.

The weakness-need of a particular Myth hero is largely based on the archetype he/she embodies.

### Major Archetypes

#### 1. Warrior
- **Strength**: the warrior is the practical enforcer of what is right.
- **Weakness**: he/she believes in the ethic "kill or be killed," and whatever is weak must be destroyed.

**Examples**: Hercules, Achilles and Hector in the *Iliad*, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in *Star Wars*, *Seven Samurai*, King Arthur, Thor, Ares, Theseus, Katniss Everdeen in *The Hunger Games*, Wonder Woman, Gilgamesh, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli in *The Lord of the Rings*.

#### 2. Searcher
The searcher looks for an object of true value. At the highest level, the hero seeks truth to achieve justice.
- **Strength**: the searcher is committed to questioning and self-improvement.
- **Weakness**: he/she can be purposeless and uncommitted.

**Examples**: knights seeking the Holy Grail, Jason searching for the Golden Fleece, and the detective.

#### 3. Teacher
- **Strength**: the teacher spreads knowledge so people can live better lives and society can improve.
- **Weakness**: he/she can force students to think a certain way or glorify himself or herself rather than his or her teachings.

**Examples**: *Dead Poets Society*, *Goodbye Mr. Chips*, Yoda, Mary Poppins, Howard Beale in *Network*, and Hannibal Lecter in *The Silence of the Lambs*.

#### 4. Rebel
- **Strength**: the rebel takes action against a system that is enslaving people.
- **Weakness**: he/she often does not provide a better alternative. The rebel is usually heroic but negative.

**Examples**: Prometheus, Loki, Neo in *The Matrix*, Heathcliff in *Wuthering Heights*, *American Beauty*, Holden Caulfield in *The Catcher in the Rye*, and Tris in *Divergent*.

#### 5. Trickster
The trickster is the most popular of all archetypes because the audience loves to see him scam the powerful.
- **Strength**: the trickster attacks the oppressive system and defeats the unjust people in power.
- **Weakness**: this character lies, cheats, and steals to get what he/she wants.

**Examples**: Odysseus (a trickster twist on the warrior archetype), Hermes, Merlin, *Beverly Hills Cop*, Verbal in *The Usual Suspects*, the Joker in *The Dark Knight*, *Men in Black*, Ferris Bueller, and Hannibal Lecter (the trickster teacher) in *The Silence of the Lambs*.

### Example: The Lord of the Rings

*The Lord of the Rings* is a unique classic Myth in that it has two heroes, and each twists a basic archetype:

1. **Hobbit Frodo Baggins**: Frodo is not the powerful warrior, but the little "man." He is heroic because of his greatness of heart and determination in the face of unbelievable odds. His weaknesses: he is small, frail, afraid, and lacks confidence.

2. **Aragorn (Strider)**: Aragorn is the dispossessed warrior-king. His weakness is that he does not believe he deserves to be king.

This vast trilogy is based on a crosscut story structure between Frodo's quest to return the ring to the fires of Mount Doom and Aragorn's quest to regain his rightful place as king.

### Example: The Wizard of Oz (Female Myth)

The character web is the first major story area where *The Wizard of Oz* takes up the mantle of the Female Myth. Oz is a land of women.

The main character, Dorothy Gale, is an orphan girl of twelve. She is undaunted by the obstacles of her young life, and she does not timidly cling to home. She is above all a resourceful girl who solves problems whenever they arise. The farm world is also dominated by females, with Auntie Em running the farm and Miss Gulch as the opponent.

Another distinctive feature that makes *The Wizard of Oz* a Female Myth is the presence of good witches as well as evil ones. Throughout history, "witches" have been an expression of women's knowledge and power. By introducing the idea of a good witch and making Glinda the most positive and powerful character in the story, the writer L. Frank Baum celebrates female power.

## Myth Story Step 5: Myth Hero—Searcher

The basic role of the hero in Myth is the same as the hero's role in the Detective genre: the searcher. But what each hero searches for is quite different. In Detective, the hero searches for the truth, usually about who committed a murder.

In Myth, a hero like Jason may search for the Golden Fleece. Odysseus searches for home. In the process of that search he finds the meaning in his own life.

**Key Point**: The Myth hero's search almost always takes him on a dangerous physical journey in which he must fight his way through the world.

## Myth Story Step 6: Weakness-Need—Becoming a Hero

The weakness-need of the Myth hero is often based on one of the early steps in the Myth form: the loss of the father. When the father either dies or disappears, the hero tries to live up to the expectations of an ideal father. In other words, the hero needs to become a hero.

**Key Point**: Becoming a hero is a need, not a specific, conscious desire.

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
In *The Wizard of Oz*, Dorothy has a run-in with Miss Gulch because her dog, Toto, got into Miss Gulch's garden. But when Dorothy complains about it to her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry they are too busy to help her. She thinks her family doesn't care about her and she wants to run away. Her true need is to find her way home so she can love and care for her family.

## Myth Story Step 7: Inciting Event—Talisman

The inciting event is the story step between weakness-need and desire. It causes the hero to come up with a goal and start taking action to reach it.

In Myth, this is typically the moment when the hero gains a talisman. A talisman is an object of power or significance.

**The talisman has two essential features:**
1. No one, including the hero, knows the true power of this object.
2. It is the physical expression of some major aspect of the hero's identity.

The talisman prompts the hero's first inkling of self-definition. The hero will gain a much deeper self-awareness of this at the end of the story.

**For the classic male Myth hero**, the talisman is often a sword, an enforcer of right action. Examples include Excalibur, the sword of King Arthur, and Anduril, Flame of the West, from *The Lord of the Rings*. Only the rightful heir to the throne can wield Anduril. Whereas Excalibur is stuck in stone, Anduril is broken and must be reforged.

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
When the cyclone takes Dorothy from Kansas to another world, she begins a new Myth story in Oz. In the scene with the Munchkins, Dorothy encounters a number of critical Myth story steps, including her talisman.

Dorothy's talisman is not the classic male symbol of the sword. It is the magical ruby slippers (silver shoes in the novel), and their true power is unknown. When the Wicked Witch demands that Dorothy give them to her, Glinda tells her, "Their magic must be very powerful or she wouldn't want them so badly."

## Myth Story Step 8: Desire—Journey and Destiny

The desire line of the hero determines the spine of the story.

**Technique: External = Internal Journey**
Make the hero's physical journey a physical manifestation of his internal journey.

In a Myth story, the hero's goal is deeply embedded within him:
- It is what he was born to do; this is his destiny. In this way, the outside goal is connected to the hero's internal need.
- It is any goal that forces the hero to go on a journey ultimately leading to himself.

This is why the Myth genre is so often circular in form: the hero eventually returns home where he discovers what has always been deep within him. Hence the central irony of the Myth story: that the hero must go on a long, physical journey to uncover the qualities he has possessed all along.

**Technique: The Journey's End Point**
Have a specific end point for the journey. Otherwise the story meanders and the audience becomes bored.

**Example: The Lord of the Rings**
Frodo's desire is to throw the ring into the fires of Mount Doom.

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
When *The Wizard of Oz* begins, Dorothy wants to leave her troubles in Kansas behind and go "over the rainbow." This desire is expressed beautifully in the first song, "Over the Rainbow."

Once Dorothy is over the rainbow, she quickly decides, "I want to go home." This goal drives the rest of the story. The plan, which Glinda provides, is to ask the wise Wizard of Oz how she can get home. Dorothy must take the hard journey down the Yellow Brick Road if she is to solve her problem and reach her goal.

### Visual Shape of the Myth Plot: Meander

The most common plot shape used in the classic Myth form is the "meander." A meander is a winding path without apparent direction. Structurally, this shape has one hero, an easy-going narrative line, and many opponents the hero meets in succession.

The meandering Myth hero covers a great deal of territory but in a haphazard way.

**Key Point**: Plot comes from encountering new opponents at different levels of society. This allows the writer to capture an entire world.

**Examples**: the *Odyssey*, *The Lord of the Rings*, *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz*, *Frozen*, *Don Quixote*, *Tom Jones* (also Comedy), *The Princess Bride* (also Comedy), *Toy Story* (also Comedy), and some of the *Harry Potter* stories (also Fantasy, Horror, and Comedy).

## Myth Story Step 9: Allies—Including Wise Old Man/Woman

The ally in Myth can be anyone. Often, one of the allies takes the form of the Wise Old Man or Wise Old Woman. This is the Teacher archetype.

**Example: The Lord of the Rings**
Samwise "Sam" Gamgee is Frodo's primary ally in his quest to return the ring to the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo's second major ally is Gandalf the Grey, the wise old wizard.

Other allies include the Hobbits Merry and Pippin, Aragorn (who is also the second hero), Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir.

**Example: The Wizard of Oz (Female Myth)**
The unique nature of the allies is another element that makes *The Wizard of Oz* a Female Myth. Dorothy is radically different than the male warrior hero of the Male Myth. So are her three male allies: the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman, and Cowardly Lion.

Like Dorothy, the allies must go on a long, difficult journey to realize what they always had within them:
- **Scarecrow** wants a brain. But he is the most capable problem-solver in the group.
- **Tin Woodsman** wants a heart. But he is the sweetest person in the story.
- **Cowardly Lion** is cowardly, but he does accompany Dorothy on her dangerous trip to the Witch's lair.

**Glinda**, the good witch, represents the Wise Old Woman/Teacher archetype. She starts Dorothy on her journey when she suggests she seek help from the Wizard of Oz. At the end Glinda tells Dorothy she always had the power to get home simply by clicking her heels together.

Another major story element that makes this a Female Myth is that Dorothy's most powerful male ally, the Wizard, is a "humbug." But he is not evil, nor is he useless to her or to Oz. By requiring Dorothy to bring back the Witch's broom, he gives her a test that proves her worthiness to herself and others.

## Myth Story Step 10: Opponent—Successive Strangers

Due to the journey form common to this genre, the Myth opponents tend to be strangers who appear in succession.

This fact poses the biggest challenge in designing the plot. The sequence of unfamiliar opponents the hero fights results in an episodic structure. Individual scenes stand out but do not connect to or build on one another.

This is also known as "hitting the same step." Actions appear to be different on the surface but are essentially the same. The plot is simply a series of fights against opponents who differ only in the way they attack the hero.

**Technique: The Opponent and Self-Revelation**
Each opponent should represent an aspect of what the hero must overcome in himself. Therefore, each time the hero defeats an opponent, he may have a minor self-revelation.

**Key Point**: In Myth, nothing is a matter of chance. Each opponent serves the purpose of challenging the hero at his weakest point.

The best example of this technique may be the knight-errant seeking the Holy Grail. As Erich Auerbach says in his seminal work on fiction, *Mimesis*, "Perils present themselves to the knight as if from the end of an assembly line."

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
*The Wizard of Oz* doesn't have the usual challenge of a succession of unfamiliar opponents. The main opponent is the Wicked Witch. The problem is that she bookends Dorothy's journey through Oz. After their initial confrontation, Dorothy doesn't come into real conflict with her until the end. The writers overcome this problem to some degree by having the Witch threaten her several times over the course of Dorothy's journey.

### Best Opponent Technique: Family Trip

To overcome the episodic nature of the Myth story structure, consider having the hero take the family along for the ride.

This is a technique from drama, in which the opponents are usually family members. Bringing the family along on the quest gives the story ongoing, intimate opponents—the family members—along with the episodic opponents the hero fights along the way. The result is a density of conflict and a story that builds to a climax.

**Example**: *Little Miss Sunshine* is a Comic Myth that uses this technique to perfection. Olive wants to win the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. She takes a long journey to the pageant accompanied by her family. Her main opponent is her father, a success guru who pressures his young daughter with unrealistic standards.

### Technique: The Ongoing Main Opponent

Try to have at least one opponent present throughout the story, and make that the main opponent.

A good story needs one main opponent the audience gets to know over the course of the story to build the drama. The more personal this character's relationship to the hero, the better the story will be.

## Myth Story Step 11: Drive—Symbolic Objects

Myth, along with Horror, is the most symbolic of all genres. This is expressed by the drive step, where the hero takes actions to reach the goal. In the process of opposing characters and objects with symbolic value while trying to reach the goal, the hero is forced to undergo a transformation of heart and mind.

**Key Point**: External symbols always mean something within the hero. Like religion, Myth uses metaphors: symbols with an established meaning.

Here are just a few of the classic symbols found in Myth stories:

### Symbolic Characters
- **ANIMALS SUCH AS HORSE, BIRD, SNAKE**: models on the path to enlightenment or hell
- **MACHINE**: superhuman, efficient but without heart and creativity
- **DEVIL**: the anti-God or Antichrist, representing the temptation of sin and the worst in humankind

### Symbolic Paths
- **THE JOURNEY**: the life path and the life span
- **LABYRINTH**:
  - the belly of the beast, or death
  - confusion and crisis en route to the path to enlightenment
- **LADDER**: stages to enlightenment

### Symbolic Objects
- **TREE**: of life and knowledge
- **CROSS**: the tree on which humanity is reborn
- **SHADOW**: the dark side, the great flaw that is profound, but potentially the source of growth. This positive meaning is often forgotten when we think of the shadow.
- **TALISMANS LIKE SWORD, BOW, SHIELD, CLOAK, SEED OF THE SACRED TREE**: right action
- **MODERN SYMBOLIC OBJECT**: Proust's madeleine cake = the Eucharist

### Symbolic Places
- **UNDERWORLD**: death and the unexplored region of the self
- **GARDEN**: being at one with the natural law, harmony within oneself and with others

**Key Point**: Even with these highly metaphorical symbols, their meaning is not fixed. Symbols are always ambiguous to some degree and ultimately depend on the reader and, especially, the context in which the symbol is used.

## Myth Story Step 12: Revelation—Opponents Attack

Over the course of the journey, the hero encounters opponents who attack in different ways. The hero has a revelation about each opponent's method of attack and comes up with unique plans to win.

Occasionally, the hero has a mini self-revelation about his own capabilities after he has defeated the opponent.

## Myth Story Step 13: Gate, Gauntlet, Visit to the Underworld

On the journey, the hero finds his way into the underworld, the land of the dead. He sees his ancestors as well as his own future. He recognizes part of his self that is not examined. He is reminded to act during his limited time on earth and makes a narrow escape.

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
Dorothy and her allies "run the gauntlet" when they must walk down a long hallway to ask the terrifying Wizard for help.

Dorothy's visit to death is also her apparent defeat. After the witch imprisons Dorothy in her castle, she flips an hourglass and says, "That's how much longer you've got to be alive."

## Myth Story Step 14: Violent Battle (Male Myth)

At the end of the journey, the male warrior hero enters into a big, bloody final battle. The stakes are epic. He defeats his greatest opponent, but he may also die in the process.

**Example: The Iliad**
*The Iliad* is an Action Epic story with major Myth elements. The final battle is between the two greatest warriors on the field: the Greek, Achilles, against the Trojan, Hector. Achilles kills Hector and drags his body behind his chariot.

**Example: Avatar**
The final battle begins with Colonel Quaritch leading a fleet of gunships to bomb the Tree of Souls. Jake on his toruk, along with his Na'vi allies on banshees, fight back. Jake blows up the Colonel's gunship. The Colonel puts on the mechanical AMP suit and shoots Neytiri's banshee, which pins her to the ground. As he moves in for the kill, Jake engages him in hand-to-hand combat. The Colonel grabs him by the hair and is about to cut his throat. Neytiri frees herself and shoots an arrow that kills the Colonel.

### Female Myth Battle

The battle step is another story step that makes *The Wizard of Oz* a Female Myth. Twelve-year-old Dorothy doesn't wield a sword in a fierce violent battle with her nemesis. There is no battle at all. She and her friends try to run away, but they are quickly cornered by the Witch's troops. When the Witch sadistically makes Dorothy watch as she sets the Scarecrow on fire, Dorothy throws a bucket of water that accidentally soaks the Witch. Water is the Witch's Achilles' heel, and she dissolves into a pile of clothes.

## Myth Story Step 15: Self-Revelation—Public/Cosmic Revelation

At the end of the battle the hero has a major self-revelation in which he realizes what he was born to do and that he always possessed the necessary abilities.

The hero's self-revelation in Myth is not just personal. It takes two forms:

### 1. Public Revelation

It is often a public revelation in which he learns that he is a king. The deeper import of this revelation is that the hero now understands he has a special responsibility to lead the community. The health of the kingdom depends on the quality of the king. Joseph Campbell refers to this step as the "Boon to Society."

When the hero is also the "Chosen One," this is the moment when he fulfills his destiny and takes on the role for which he has been groomed.

**Examples of Chosen Ones**: Moses, Jesus, King Arthur, Paul Atreides, Luke Skywalker, Neo, Jake Sully, and Harry Potter.

When the hero fails to make this character change and fulfill his duty, the hero, the society, and sometimes humankind itself falls.

**Examples of failed heroes**: Adam (Genesis) and Anakin Skywalker (*Star Wars*).

### 2. Cosmic Revelation

At this point, the hero may also have a cosmic revelation. He gains a moral vision, or epiphany, of how an entire society should exist in the world. This kind of revelation must be detailed to have any meaning to the audience.

**Examples**:
- In Exodus, in the Old Testament, Moses goes to the mountaintop and receives the cosmic moral vision of the Ten Commandments.
- Jesus's Sermon on the Mount expresses the Christian moral code in what is known as the Beatitudes, Matthew 5:3-12. Examples include "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven," and "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth."
- In *Avatar*, Jake has his cosmic revelation when he joins and communicates with the spirit of Eywa at the Tree of Souls.

### Technique: The Mythic vs. the Tragic Ending

Myth is an earlier story form than Tragedy, which is the highest expression of Drama. Myth and Tragedy differ particularly in how they end.

**Myth** involves the immortality of the hero, even if it's only from telling the story (Epic of Gilgamesh).

**Tragedy** involves cutting off life too early, with no rebirth of the hero, and only the bittersweet sense of what might have been. The hero may have a self-revelation, but it comes too late.

## Myth Story Step 16: New Equilibrium—Outgrow the Code

The hero returns home and is profoundly changed by his experience. Often he marries or remarries. The *Odyssey* is the textbook example of the remarriage of the hero.

Instead of changing the beliefs of the code he has lived by, the hero has outgrown the code entirely. He is reborn, spiritually and often literally.

**In his spiritual rebirth:**
- He sees the world and acts in a new way.
- He is in tune with his destiny and the larger forces of nature.

**Example: The Wizard of Oz**
Dorothy completes the classic Myth circle when she finds herself back home, re-creating the community. She has fulfilled her need to appreciate her family. She is ecstatic to be back with her aunt and uncle and her family of friends. Her self-revelation is strictly personal: "There's no place like home."

In the film, Dorothy discovers that it was all a dream. In the novel, her journey was real and she will return many more times to Oz in later books.

## Theme: Being Is Self-Questioning and a Search for My Destiny

In its simplest form, Myth is the story of an action hero who goes on a long quest to find himself and live forever. Therefore, in Myth, being is not about simply taking action. It is about creating one's self and one's life.

As a result, being means constantly questioning oneself, especially about the morality of one's actions. These actions affect others in the social order. Self-questioning even means attacking oneself to get at the truth of how to become who one really is. This is not just a momentary pursuit, but a lifelong existential quest.

**Key Point**: Becoming who you are isn't just a passive activity of "be yourself." It is the most active, difficult work we will ever do.

The day-to-day experience of being is also a search for one's destiny. Myth defines destiny as what someone was born to do. This appears to involve fate or divine intervention. But destiny comes from within, from one's own abilities. The problem is that one is never fully aware, or often even remotely aware, of what one's true capabilities are.

Myth, more than any other genre, is focused on the idea that being is becoming. Being is the tactics of the present. What we want to become makes up our strategic vision. These are the broad views that really determine our success as human beings.

**Key Point**: Myth also says that being is in constant conflict with becoming and must be reconciled.

The "Being Mind," caught up in the day-to-day, doesn't want to think about its own end. We act "as if" we will not die. This appears to be a useful tool for our survival. We can concentrate on what is needed to eat and work and mate. But it is not a tool for good survival, for living life well.

### Myth Thematic Recipe: The Way of the Searcher

A genre's thematic recipe for the "good life" comes primarily from the hero's basic action and the form's key question. Since Myth says that being is becoming, the Myth recipe is "being" broken down into detailed steps of action.

The Myth hero's basic action is to seek. He usually has a specific goal at the end of the journey. But the real question he wants to answer is: What is my destiny? What was I born to do with my life?

Myth says if you can find that and do it, you will have a good life and gain some form of immortality. This becomes clear only at the end point of the hero's desire line. There he replaces his first and main goal with his true goal, to know his destiny in life. Therefore, destiny is life's version of immortality.

Immortality is the central theme of the Myth form. This is made physical through the plot: birth, the hero's actions in life, death of the old self, and rebirth. But it is also shown in new action the hero takes after the self-revelation.

A second part of the Myth recipe for a good life comes from finding our place in the natural order. In this sense, Myth has an ecological, holistic Story Code. Living an enlightened life is living in cosmic harmony. This is not some esoteric notion of becoming a god. It involves the hard work of getting away from our overwhelming subjectivity, seeing how all the elements of the world depend on one another, and then acting in a way that doesn't place our own ambition above the lives of others.

## Male Myth vs. Female Myth

Plot in Myth can be both linear and cyclical:
- The linear sequence comes from the "male" Myth, based on the goal of the hunt.
- The circular sequence comes from the "female" Myth, based on the agricultural cycle and the changing of the seasons.

In both Male and Female Myths, however, the hero's physical journey is often circular: the hero returns home, where he/she learns a truth that was always deep inside.

**Key Point**: While the Female and Male Myth forms differ in a number of story steps as they play out the broader Myth genre, we could say that the basic thematic difference between them is this: **the Male Myth is about divide and conquer, while the Female Myth is about combine and grow.**

### Male Myth Characteristics
- Linear plot based on the hunt/quest
- Hero is typically a warrior
- Emphasis on battles and physical conflict
- Ends with violent battle
- Value system: divide and conquer
- Shame culture (reputation, honor, public face)
- Loss of the father
- Sword as talisman (enforcement of right)

### Female Myth Characteristics
- Circular/cyclical plot based on agricultural cycle
- Hero emphasizes growth and connection
- Multiple rebirths throughout story
- Ends with return home and community restoration
- Value system: combine and grow
- Guilt culture (relationships, responsibility)
- Good witches as well as evil (celebrating female power)
- Non-violent talisman (seeds, shoes)
- Allies are non-traditional (not warriors)
- Male allies may lack traditional strength but have other qualities
- Main male ally may be revealed as fake/weak but not evil
- Battle is non-violent problem-solving

**Key Point**: The shift from Male Myth to Female Myth represents a major shift in values—from revenge to forgiveness, from conquest to growth, from individual glory to community harmony.

### Example: The Iliad vs. The Odyssey

**The Iliad** (Male/Shame Culture):
- Story of the great warrior Achilles
- Seeks immortality through battle
- Shame comes from disrespecting opponent (dragging Hector's body)
- Climax of ten years of fighting

**The Odyssey** (Movement Toward Female/Guilt Culture):
- Tracks ten years of getting home
- Wily warrior who searches for home and lives
- Odysseus goes from fighter to searcher to lover
- Chooses mortality with loving wife over immortal glory
- Guilt toward wife for lack of faithfulness

The Odyssey represents the process from the powerful warrior who fights to the death to the wily warrior who searches for home and lives.

### The Story of Jesus Christ: First Female Myth in Western Canon

Seen strictly from the point of view of structure, the story of Jesus is a Myth-Fantasy. It embodies the massive shift in Western culture from Male Myth to Female Myth. It marks the transition from the male warrior-shame culture of Rome (the "master morality") to a female-guilt culture (the "slave morality").

Jesus is only a warrior in courage. He is a man of love, not just for one's mate or family, but for all humankind.

**Key Point**: The story of Jesus represents a massive transformation of values from revenge to forgiveness and is the first major Female Myth since Male Myth wiped out Female Myth three thousand years ago.

Christ's recipe for how to live a successful life appears to be based on the act of loving one's neighbor as oneself. In practice, Christ's teachings of self-improvement come into play not in the act of loving others but in response to what others do to us.

When wronged, the natural response of the warrior-shame culture is revenge. Forgiveness is the practical response of the weak. Forgiveness is the ultimate tool of guilt culture. By depriving oneself of the pleasure of balancing the moral accounts, the individual also deprives the offender of closing the accounts. Instead, the individual forces the offender to wallow in feelings of guilt for what he has done.

## Transcending Myth 1: The Myth/Science Fiction Epic

The most ambitious transcendent Myth stories are those that track the development of a culture and its ideas. These include creation and origin myths, the Great Chain of Being, and the science of evolution.

Most transcendent Myth stories track the creation and development of a culture, the worldwide "zeitgeist" (spirit of the time), and what Hegel called the "Universal Mind."

### Creation Myths: The Big Becoming of Culture

The first kind of transcendent Myth is the Creation Myth. This story form is the history of a particular culture and of how the parts fit together to make up the whole. It lays out a set of values that the society believes will lead to a good life for all.

**Key Point**: A Creation Myth is not the story of creating the physical world. It is about creating consciousness and culture.

Creation Myths begin by naming the foundation's parts. "God created the heavens and the earth..." and Man ate from the tree of Knowledge.

Once the mind makes distinctions with names, self-consciousness is possible. This means we can see the Other, not just out there, but in ourselves. Only then can we create a set of values by which to live, creating a tribe of "us."

After the tribe of "us" has been created, the next step is to focus on the family, the first society. Society is the structure by which people are organized. Culture is composed of the ideas by which the society operates.

**Example: King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table**
This tells the modern story of the transition from monarchy to democracy. Twelve of the greatest knights in the land sit as near equals around a circular table with their king. With the king's leadership, they decide the fate of the nation.

**Key Point**: While the Western is the Creation Myth of the United States, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table is the true Creation Myth of England and the modern republic.

### The Origin Story

An Origin Story is different from a Creation Myth. An Origin Story tracks the beginning of a particular character while a Creation Myth tracks the beginning of an entire world and culture.

The Origin Story is often the most popular in a story series. It allows the audience to share in the birth of the mythology and it has a shape that sequels often lack.

**Key Point**: By tracking the formation of the hero, the Origin Story expresses the single most important technique of good storytelling: creating plot from character.

**Examples**: Epic of Gilgamesh, *Black Panther*, *Batman Begins*, *Guardians of the Galaxy*, *Casino Royale*, *X-Men*, *X-Men Origins: Wolverine*, *The Incredible Hulk*, and *Fantastic Four*.

**Example: Black Panther**
*Black Panther* is a landmark film because it is the Origin Story of both a Black superhero, Black Panther, and the Creation Story of a technologically advanced African nation, Wakanda.

**Key Point**: The success of this Origin Story comes from matching the moral growth of the hero and the nation.

T'Challa must earn his right to be king through ritual hand-to-hand combat. His flaw is that he accepts the policy of keeping Wakanda secret from the world. In the final battle, T'Challa defeats Killmonger. He then has a moral self-revelation in which he commits to building an outreach center in the inner city in America. He also has a cosmic revelation about the need to use Wakandan knowledge to help the world. In a speech at the United Nations he reveals Wakanda's true identity.

### Evolution and the Myth/Science Fiction Epic

The Myth/Science Fiction Epic provides a story form for the most revolutionary idea in history, evolution.

**Example: 2001: A Space Odyssey**
**Key Point**: 2001 shows creation not of space but of time. In the longest growth track of any story since the Bible, the film sequences four evolutionary stages of humankind, from apelike hominid to universal baby.

In old Creation Myths like Genesis and Norse mythology, a god creates the world from scratch. 2001 is creation through evolution, and that makes all the difference.

The story proceeds through four types of characters depicting four major stages of universal evolution:
1. apelike hominid, to
2. human, who succeeds through invention of tools and particularly weapons, to
3. machine in the form of HAL, who is not quite perfect, to
4. Star Child, birth of the universal baby

The best character in 2001 is HAL, the computer, who functions as the opponent. He is simply a big eye and a voice. Yet, HAL has the most dialogue of any character in the story. Ironically, he also gives us the deepest insight into what it means to have human consciousness.

The idea that the machine is more human than the human beings is central to the entire Science Fiction form.

## Transcending Myth 2: The Female Myth

A better strategy for writers wishing to succeed in today's worldwide market is to write a story based on one of the emerging Myth forms—most notably the Female Myth.

**Example: Avatar—Science Fiction Male Myth to Female Myth**
*Avatar* puts the Male Myth versus the Female Myth in opposition and shows us how the Female Myth model is the future for living in this world.

Thematically, *Avatar* is a perfect example of Male Myth's emphasis on divide and conquer versus Female Myth's emphasis on combine and grow.

The story begins by establishing Male Myth elements:
- Jake is a professional soldier
- Mining operation is large, technologically advanced organization
- Parker's desire for unobtainium expresses primary value of tech culture: money
- Expresses male recipe for success: divide and conquer

The Female Myth steps take over as the story progresses:

**Multiple Rebirths**: Jake undergoes throughout the film:
1. First rebirth: takes his twin brother's place ("One life ends, another begins")
2. Second rebirth: presented with his Na'vi avatar (born in watery high-tech womb)
3. Third rebirth: cultural—ritual ceremony, invited into tribe. The scene ends with overhead shot of entire tribe connecting in a circle around him (perfect visual expression of Female Myth: combine and grow)
4. Fourth and final rebirth: at the sacred tree, begins marriage to Neytiri as a Na'vi

**Talisman Shift**: From male object to female object:
- Neytiri almost shoots Jake with an arrow
- Hundreds of floating seeds alight on him (from sacred mother tree)
- Arrow = male warrior (who Jake is now)
- Seed = who he will become
- Excellent example of plot coming from character

**The Chosen One (Different Kind)**: The seeds indicate he is the Chosen One who will be the leader of a people. But this requires him to grow mentally, emotionally, and morally.

**Cosmic Revelation**: At the sacred tree, Jake says of the Sky People, "They killed their mother." In other words, they killed the Female Myth.

**Final Rebirth**: Completes the circular journey with the hero returning home profoundly changed. New home at the vortex point (sacred tree). Fourth and final rebirth as a Na'vi.

## Transcending Myth 3: The Ecological Myth

Another new and transcendent Myth form is the Ecological Myth. It tracks the invasion of the natural world by technological force and development. It shows how the world could overcome ecological disaster, balancing individual, family, society, and nature.

Over the course of the story, the hero changes from a technological to a natural human being. In effect she goes backward in time, both culturally (from cityscape to pastoral setting) and personally (from adult to child).

The Ecological Myth shares some of the steps of Female Myth, especially multiple rebirths and the overall process of "combine and grow."

In a final rebirth of the hero and the world, the main character becomes a new kind of person, combining nature and technology. At the same time, harmony is established between the city and nature. The hero learns how to live in the city with insights from nature and brings positive elements from the city to nature. This end point includes a marriage of science and myth. Civilized human is renewed through natural forces.

### The Negative Version: Machine in the Garden

In this form, the hero tries to defend nature, but loses the battle against the forces of technology. The machine destroys the garden. City and nature remain unconnected and there is no insight into how a new balance between them is possible.

**Examples of Ecological Myth**: *Avatar* (positive—also Female Myth), *Dances with Wolves*, many novels of Thomas Hardy, *Tree of Life*, *The Magnificent Ambersons*, *Days of Heaven*, *The New World*.

## Examples of Myth Stories
