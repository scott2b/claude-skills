## Crime Story Overview

### What is Crime?

**Crime is fictional moral philosophy.**

The Crime story is about people who break the law and those who catch them. It is based on the starting principle that everyone in society has equal rights as human beings. Therefore, the story is about restoring fairness and justice whenever that fundamental human law is violated.

**Overall story strategy**: Pit a criminal who thinks he's above society against a defender of society's rules and values.

### Why Crime is a Primary Genre

Crime is a primary genre because it highlights:
- The unacceptable desires people have when living within a society
- That fulfilling those desires may hurt someone else
- The means one can and cannot use to achieve one's desires

This in turn highlights the difference between **legality** and **morality**:
- **Legality**: What the law allows
- **Morality**: What is good and right to do

They are not always the same. When that happens, the question arises: What is the proper response?

### Crime's Place in the Genre Sequence

If Science Fiction is about creating society, Crime is about upholding the laws upon which the society is based, and without which the society cannot operate.

## The Crime Mind-Action Story View

### Moral Accounting

The Crime version of Mind-Action is that **life is a constant attempt at moral accounting**.

In trying to reach one's desires in a society, each of us uses others and occasionally harms them. On the ledger between the two individuals, each action is recorded, along with what is owed.

This happens countless times every day in ways big and small, morally and legally. Laws are simply moral rules enforced by the governing body of the society.

### Balancing the Books

In a social world, the moral accounting must always be balanced. An action must be paid for. If I use or transgress you, I must pay for it in kind. If I do not pay, there will be conflict.

Balancing the books becomes more difficult and complex when moral action is at odds with legal action. If I believe I must take an illegal action to balance the moral books, I accept the price I must pay.

**Example**: Antigone feels she must bury her brother in spite of the king's edict against it. For that she dies.

### The Law of Necessary Cost of Living

Once again, the Law of Necessary Cost of Living rears its ugly head, and that cost is high.

## Crime Compared to Other Genres

### Crime vs. Detective vs. Thriller

**Detective and Thriller** are concerned first and foremost with finding the truth. That truth is usually about who is guilty of the crime. But the action that tracks the storyline is investigation. Assigning guilt only comes at the end.

**Crime stories** put less emphasis on the detection of the criminal (Detective) and more emphasis on the contest between criminal and lawman (Action). The story begins with someone committing an illegal act. In the process of applying justice, the transcendent Crime story questions whether the illegal act is immoral, and whether true justice has been done.

### Crime as Fictional Moral Philosophy

Crime is fictional moral philosophy. In fact, Crime is simply a more expansive version of the moral argument found in every story and every genre.

**KEY POINT**: All Story tracks the costs of the hero's means to reach an end.

### Crime vs. Action

Although Action shares certain elements of Crime, it is Crime's opposite thematically:
- **Action** starts from the point of view of the individual and is about superiority. It's about how to be successful in getting what one wants and rising to the top of the hierarchy.
- **Crime** starts from the point of view of the society and is about everyone being fundamentally equal, at least in basic human rights. It's about making sure no one takes advantage of someone else as they try to gain a good life.

## Crime Story Beats

### Crime Story Beat 1: Story World - Slavery of Superficial Society

Crime stories focus on how people live together in society. Specifically, how do people get what they want when others say they cannot or should not want it?

**The Crime story world can take one of two extremes (both are dystopias):**

1. **World where there is no crime**: All desires and all actions needed to accomplish those desires are permitted. The result is a chaotic state of nature, with total power taken by those with money and guns.

2. **Fascist police state**: Almost everything a person does to realize desire is a crime.

Modern culture tries to walk the line between these two extremes to produce the best overall society.

**Whatever story world is depicted in a Crime story, it is always a place where:**
- People are living on a surface reality
- People live "lives of quiet desperation" (Thoreau)
- People are simply unselfconscious

The society in the Crime story is also one of extreme wealth and poverty. The possibility of moving up the social ladder through hard work is almost gone. Therefore, some people turn to crime.

### Crime Story Beat 2: Inciting Event - Crime

The criminal commits a crime that catapults him to a new level of wealth or power.

#### TECHNIQUE: Ingenious Crime

Because the story often tracks the master criminal, whether he is hero or opponent, make the crime ingenious. The crime is the expression in action of the brilliance of the criminal's mind and artistry. If he's a master criminal, we want to see what he comes up with.

**Example - *The Dark Knight***: Begins with the Joker robbing a bank. Part of his plan is to have one of the robbers back a school bus through a bank wall, thereby killing the other robber. The Joker then kills the driver and drives away with all the money.

Before leaving, the Joker tells an injured customer, "I believe whatever doesn't kill you makes you stranger." This is a cute flip of the Nietzschean line, "Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger." Thus, the Joker identifies himself as a twisted, negative version of the Nietzschean Overman.

**Example - *The Usual Suspects***: One of the most ingenious crimes in film history. Hero Verbal is the master criminal. His crime is ingenious because he is an artist of crime, in particular, a master storyteller. He does this in four main ways:
1. He makes up the whole story from the photos, articles, and wanted posters pinned to the bulletin board behind the FBI agent
2. He pretends to be the ally, fooling the apparent hero Keaton, FBI Agent Kujan, and the audience
3. He pretends to be weak and stupid when he is strong and smart
4. He creates a fake opponent, the ruthless criminal named Keyser Söze, to deflect attention from himself as the real killer

**KEY POINT**: The more deception the criminal uses, the better the Crime story will be.

### Crime Story Beat 3: Cop Hero Strengths and Weakness-Need

Within this dark and divided social world, we introduce the hero. In Crime, the hero is either the enforcer or the criminal. The fact that the hero can be either cop or outlaw means that we're exploring the mirror image of the person on either side of the law.

#### The Master Cop

The cop lives at a deeper level than others of the society and is even deeper than the master criminal.

**KEY POINT**: The cop is a regular person but especially good at his job. In other words, he is the master cop.

This element of the master cop is found in the prototypical modern Crime story, *Crime and Punishment*. The brilliant criminal Raskolnikov is no match for police investigator Porfiry Petrovich. Similarly, the rich, haughty killer in the typical Columbo episode is no match for the humble, dumpy Columbo, a character modeled on Porfiry.

#### Cop's Weakness-Need

Even a master cop has a strong weakness-need:
- He may be poor, average, or lonely
- He doesn't fit in with society
- Ironically, he lives according to the best values of that society and has a stronger faith in it than anyone else

**Thematic implication**: The truly great individual is not the person with the most power, money, or status, even though those things are what the society publicly prizes the most. It's the person who does great work within the rules. This person wins the game not by cheating, but by playing straight.

### Crime Story Beat 4: Values and Moral Code

In every genre the hero begins believing in a set of values that will then be challenged over the course of the story. In many genres, these values are so specific that they make up a moral code of ethics.

Since either cop or criminal can be the hero in a Crime story, here is the basic moral code of each:

#### Cop's Moral Code

1. **The law is holy and must be enforced at all costs.**
2. **Brotherhood among police force**: Like soldiers, cops understand and rely on each other for their duty and their lives. Therefore, they work by an unwritten code of silence that they will not turn in a fellow cop, even if he breaks the law (despite the first value).

#### Criminal's Moral Code

1. **Honor among thieves**: There are examples of this in real life. But given that a criminal is by definition only out for himself and violates others to get it, the opposite idea, that there is no honor among thieves, is more likely to be true.

2. **Code of silence (omertà)**: In organized crime, especially the mafia, this is quite real. Here, the success of the organization, as opposed to the individual, makes this an absolute value broken at the cost of death.

### Crime Story Beat 5: Desire - Catch a Criminal

In all genres, the desire line of the hero determines the spine of the story. Crime, like Horror, establishes the hero's desire after the opponent attacks.

#### Cop Hero

With a cop hero, the desire is to **catch a criminal**.

Notice this is different than the desire in the Detective form, which is to find the truth. This goal explains why the Crime genre is a blend of Detective and Action. The cop usually figures out fairly easily who committed the crime. The emphasis then is on the battle of wits as the cop tries to catch the criminal.

#### TECHNIQUE: Crime Stories with a Criminal Hero

Make the criminal at least partially justified in breaking the law to get what he wants.

This technique has two main benefits:
1. The criminal hero becomes more complex and appealing
2. The cop is torn between his desire to catch the criminal and his desire for the criminal to succeed

**Example - *Les Misérables***: Jean Valjean's original crime is stealing bread for his starving sister and her family. The cop is the relentless and unforgiving Inspector Javert. In the end, inspired by the mercy Valjean has shown him, Javert lets Valjean go. But he is haunted by his failure to do his duty. So he commits suicide.

**Example - *The Thomas Crown Affair***: Crown wants to rob a bank to show he is master of the game and cannot be caught. Insurance investigator Vicki (the cop) wants to defeat him in the game and catch him. She is also in love with him.

### Visual Shapes of the Crime Plot

#### Linear Shape

Like Horror and Action, Crime uses the most popular story shape, the linear. The hero has a single goal that he chases with intensity and one main opponent trying to stop him.

#### Branching Shape

When Crime subgenres like Social Drama have multiple heroes, they are more likely to use the branching shape to sequence the plot.

**Examples of single-hero-linear Social Drama**: *Norma Rae*, *Roma*, *Erin Brockovich*, *Boys Don't Cry*, *The Accused*, *Antigone*

**Examples of multiple-hero-branching Social Drama**: *The Help*, *Traffic*, *Nashville*, *Crash*, *21 Grams*, *Babel*

### Crime Story Beat 6: Opponent/Mystery - Super Criminal

The Crime opponent can be criminal or cop. Again, we're playing with the mirror image of the person on either side of the law.

#### The Master Criminal

Whether he is the hero or the opponent, the criminal is usually brilliant and/or a master at beating the system.

The criminal feels that because he is such a superior individual, he should be able to live by his own rules. He feels he can play the game of life deeper or faster than the human sheep that surround him.

The criminal's goal is money, power, or to win the game and prove he is superior to everyone else.

**Examples of master-criminal-as-hero**: Rodion Raskolnikov (*Crime and Punishment*), Thomas Crown (*The Thomas Crown Affair*), Verbal (*The Usual Suspects*), Walter White/Heisenberg (*Breaking Bad*)

**Examples of master-criminal-as-opponent**: The Joker (*The Dark Knight* and *Joker*), Hannibal Lecter (*Silence of the Lambs*), Moriarty (Sherlock Holmes), Alain Charnier (*The French Connection*), Villanelle (*Killing Eve*)

#### The Joker as Ultimate Opponent

There is no greater criminal than the Joker in *The Dark Knight*. He is a genius psychopath whose massive intellect is shown by his ability to plot. He accuses District Attorney Harvey Dent and Batman of being schemers. But he is the master schemer, a modern Moriarty who acts not out of greed or revenge but for the game.

The Joker is literally the author of Gotham City, in that he constructs criminal plots that will remake the city to express his moral vision. Many have described the Joker as a nihilist, a man in love with chaos. But this is a serious misreading.

If Batman is the Dark Knight, the Joker is the Dark Philosopher. The entire plot of *The Dark Knight* is a series of moral conundrums the Joker creates to expose what he believes is the true animal nature of humankind. This plot tracks the beats of the modern Crime story going all the way back to its origin, *Crime and Punishment*.

**The Joker constructs ever more difficult versions of the genre's central question: What would you do if you had to choose between two bad moral options?**

### Crime Story Beat 7: Drive - Cat and Mouse

The middle of the Crime story is a series of conflicts where cop and criminal match wits and force. This is the cat and mouse struggle, one-on-one, master cop versus master criminal.

**KEY POINT**: In the top Crime stories, both cop and criminal are the best at their respective jobs, and both are equal in ability.

This is essential to creating a heavyweight fight between the combatants. While fans of Horror want to feel constant and building pressure, fans of Crime want to see intense punch-counterpunch between cop and criminal in a fifteen-round bloodbath.

#### TECHNIQUE: Obsessive Cop

During the Drive step, show the cop becoming obsessed and going too far to catch the criminal, thus acting like the criminal.

This sequence of immoral action blends two characters the audience thinks are opposites. Instead of good cop versus bad criminal, black versus white, we see that they are in many ways similar.

This technique in the moral argument of the Crime story comes from the genre's underlying theme, which is to explore the thin line between acting inside and outside the law.

**Why is this crucial to the transcendent version of the genre?** In a morally relative world, the line between right and wrong is never clear. This is especially true when the story explores the difference between what is legal and what is moral.

This technique also brings up other key questions:
- Who is committing the bigger crime?
- Is it the criminal who goes against society's laws of what is appropriate to want and the proper means to get it?
- Or is it the cop who is forcing an individual to deaden his life and become part of the mass?

**Example - *The Dark Knight***: Batman is interrogating the Joker in a sealed room in the police station.

> BATMAN: Then why do you want to kill me?
> THE JOKER: I don't want to kill you! What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? No, no, no! You... you ... complete ... me.
> BATMAN: You're garbage who kills for money.
> THE JOKER: Don't talk like one of them. You're not! Even if you'd like to be. To them, you're just a freak, like me. They need you right now. But when they don't, they'll cast you out, like a leper. You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these ... these civilized people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve.

#### The Predictability Problem

This technique contributes to the biggest problem writers face in the Crime story plot. The cop crossing the line is so common to the form that we expect it. We know the cop will break the law for the higher good of catching the criminal. That makes the plot predictable. The best way to overcome predictability of plot is through deception.

### Crime Story Beat 8: Opponent's Plan and Main Counterattack

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST OFTEN MISSING BEAT.**

The opponent's strategy to get the goal. What hidden attacks has the opponent devised? How will these attacks be sprung on the hero (each is a revelation)? What is the main counterattack?

**KEY POINT**: The more intricate the opponent's plan, and the better it's hidden, the better the plot will be.

Most writers focus only on the hero's plan and forget that the opponent also has a detailed strategy. In Crime, where the opponent is often a master criminal, this plan is crucial.

#### TECHNIQUE: Deceptive Attack

Make both cop and criminal masters of the game by using deception where each surprises the other and the audience. This includes where and how an attack will be made. It is especially important that each character hides their overall campaign of attack.

### Crime Story Beat 9: Reveal - Criminal Uncovered

The crime reveal is usually about the trickery the criminal uses to escape the cop. To set this up, think of the criminal as an artist of crime.

Ask yourself: What are the hidden attacks that will cause the most trouble for the hero?

**Example - *The Dark Knight***: The Joker makes a video of a fake Batman and directly challenges the real Batman to catch him.

### Crime Story Beat 10: Drive - Moral Argument

Like most genres, the Crime form highlights certain structural elements above others to get their effects. Crime emphasizes the moral argument, which focuses on the immoral and illegal actions the hero takes to win.

To prevent the theme from being heavy-handed, the writer must express the moral argument through the plot.

#### How Plot Carries Moral Argument

Here's an example of how plot might carry moral argument in a simple Crime story:
1. The hero (whether cop, criminal, or average citizen) commits an illegal act
2. To hide his responsibility and avoid punishment, he commits another illegal act
3. The police or other criminals respond, which puts the hero into an even tighter moral bind
4. He then makes another mistake
5. And so on...

### Crime Story Beat 11: Apparent Defeat - The Criminal Escapes

The apparent defeat is when the hero believes he has lost the fight against the opponent. This is one of the main techniques for telling any story as dramatically as possible, since in the vast majority of cases the hero comes back to win.

In the Crime form, the apparent defeat occurs when the criminal escapes or wins a major victory.

**Example - *The Dark Knight***: The Joker tricks Batman into going to the wrong location, and Rachel, the woman he loves, dies in an explosion.

### Crime Story Beat 12: Gate-Gauntlet-Visit to Death - Chase

The Gate-Gauntlet-Visit to Death beat usually happens just before the battle step. The hero is under immense pressure in the contest with the main opponent. This pressure often translates into the constricted space through which the hero moves. At this moment, he passes through a narrow gate, walks down a long gauntlet while being attacked from either side, and/or has a sense of his approaching death.

**The Crime version of this story beat is often a big chase.** Here Crime borrows from Action: the chase is cat and mouse at top speed.

#### Example - *The Dark Knight*: The Prisoner's Dilemma

*The Dark Knight* gives us a brilliant expression of the beat. The Joker sets up a massive version of the Prisoner's Dilemma. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, police place two prisoners in separate rooms and give them each a choice: confess or stay silent. If one stays silent while the other confesses, the punishment will be more severe. So, because of distrust, each prisoner is tempted to betray the other.

The Joker re-creates the Prisoner's Dilemma on a grand scale by setting two ships against each other. One is filled with commuters, the other with hardened criminals. The passengers are given the choice of pushing a button to blow up the other ship before the other ship destroys them. If neither ship pulls the trigger by midnight, the Joker will destroy them both.

His assumption: when forced to choose between trusting the humanity of strangers and their own survival, each group will kill the other.

The brilliance of this plot beat comes from the larger plot and thematic sequence of the story. Up until this moment, the Joker has forced Batman to make a series of moral choices that have become progressively more difficult. They are all designed to make the case that man is just an animal with a thin veneer of morality. Now the Joker takes the choice out of Batman's hands. The Joker will use a herd of humans to prove his point.

### Crime Story Beat 13: Violent Battle or Big Revelation

Since the Crime story desire is to catch a criminal, the battle is the final violent confrontation between criminal and cop. Usually this happens in a pitched gunfight deep in the bowels of the city.

**The big action battle between cop and criminal is the final legal accounting in the story. It is almost always enforced with a gun.**

#### In Transcendent Crime Stories

In transcendent Crime stories, this beat may be a big reveal, which moves the Crime story closer to the Detective genre. The crime reveal is usually based on the trickery the criminal uses to escape the cop.

To see why this beat is found in transcendent Crime stories, we must remember that the criminal is an artist. To defeat the cop he must use extreme trickery. **The closer you can push the big reveal to the end of the story, the better the story will be.**

#### Example - *The Usual Suspects*

*The Usual Suspects* contains perhaps the greatest reveal in the history of the Crime story. FBI agent Kujan realizes the truth at the last minute. In quick succession, he and the audience learn that:
1. Verbal made up the entire story
2. He isn't the weak, mousy man we thought he was
3. He created the opponent, Keyser Söze
4. Verbal is Keyser Söze; he is the killer

#### TECHNIQUE: Final Reveal

The final reveal is one of the keys to great plotting in any story form. For many writers, this is the biggest technique holding them back from success.

**Plan your reveals at the beginning of the story. Make each part of the opponent's overall, interconnected campaign of attack against the hero.**

### Crime Story Beat 14: Self-Revelation - Society Reaffirmed

The normal self-revelation in the Crime story occurs when the cop reaffirms the values of living in society and within the law. This is true even if the citizens are relatively shallow and do not appreciate him.

**Example - *Fargo***: During a cold and cloudy Minnesota winter's day, Police Chief Marge Gunderson takes the killer to jail.

> MARGE: So, that was Mrs. Lundegaard on the floor there. And I guess that was your accomplice in the wood chipper. And those three people in Brainerd. And for what? For a little bit of money? There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don'tcha know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Well, I just don't understand it.

#### Negative Version: Society Loses

**Example - *The Thomas Crown Affair***: Crown defeats the law and the brilliant insurance investigator he has come to love. She realizes she has lost and made the biggest mistake of her life. We are glad to see this great individual get away. The artist in the game of life beats the system. But it's a Pyrrhic victory. He is alone, having spurned what may be the love of his life.

#### Mixed Version

**Example - *The Dark Knight***: Gives us a mixed self-revelation in a finale going all the way back to the classic Western *The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance*. In that film, when it turns out the hero of a gunfight didn't actually kill the bad guy, the newspaperman refuses to print the truth. He says, "When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."

Batman decides to let District Attorney Harvey Dent die a hero, so the people will have hope in justice. Batman, the true hero, takes the role of the scapegoat. The society is reaffirmed through lying.

### Crime Story Beat 15: Moral Argument Conclusion - Poetic Justice

In the standard Crime story, the conclusion of the moral argument is simple: the criminal is punished and the law is upheld.

But while the justice system enforces legal accounting, it does not necessarily produce justice. Laws are only a rough estimate of moral accounting.

#### Moral Accounting

The basic moral accounting between two people must always be made equal. This simple but powerful equation is expressed in the Old Testament saying "An eye for an eye."

**KEY POINT**: "An eye for an eye" is not just about finding a punishment to fit the crime. It is the symbol of the deeper desire to close the wound and equal the books. Only then can the victim feel that justice has been done.

#### Forgiveness

The New Testament adds a new wrinkle to one's sense of justice through the idea of forgiveness. When an eye for an eye is not possible, the victim is helpless to heal the psychic wound. Forgiveness provides the victim some measure of freedom from the shackles of rage and resentment. But forgiveness is not a substitute for justice, so it does not balance the books.

#### Systemic Punishment

The modern justice system tries to replace an eye for an eye with systemic punishment. Laws evolved so that a vengeful form of moral accounting would not destroy the social fabric through endless feuds. In those cases, the collateral damage becomes far worse than the original crime. Plus, systemic punishment prevents vengeance against the wrong person.

Although punishment through the justice system may give the victim some sense of revenge, it is always a poor substitute. Unless the system metes out justice with some equivalent to an eye for an eye, the account is not settled and the victim is still owed.

#### Poetic Justice

Crime and Detective stories give us the outcome rarely found in life through the technique of "poetic justice."

**Poetic justice is:**
- Payment in kind
- Payment unique to that crime
- Karmic reckoning
- Payment by the offender's own hand

**Example - Hamlet**: When Hamlet plots the destruction of his friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who have betrayed him, he says:

> For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
> Hoist with his own petard, an't shall go hard.
> But I will delve one yard below their mines.
> And blow them at the moon.

In short, their own bomb will blow them up.

We see examples of poetic justice in Detective stories like *Murder on the Orient Express*, *L.A. Confidential*, and *Vertigo*, as well as in the transcendent Thriller *The Conversation*.

## Morality Story Beats

For transcendent Crime stories (Epic Crime Tragedy and Crime Black Comedy), the writer must layer morality story beats on top of the basic Crime beats. These eight beats create the advanced moral argument that elevates Crime to its highest form.

### The Art and Story of Morality

For someone to break the law, we must first make the law.

**Law = moral code turned into a legal code.** The legal code provides detail and lays out how it will be enforced.

A transcendent Crime story gives the writer three challenging tasks:
1. Re-create the moral system of the larger culture of the story
2. Give the hero a personal moral code
3. Show how that character breaks their personal code over the course of the story

### Defining Morality

**Morality is a system of relative value.** Values are not abstract objects like Freedom, Justice, Loyalty, and the like. They are ways of acting. A person assigns an abstract value to each way of acting. These are set against other valuable ways of acting. Therefore, when someone lives by a moral code, they balance the various ways of acting available in that situation at that moment.

This has two ramifications:
1. **Values exist only in action.** Therefore, what we call "values" are meaningless unless the individual chooses a particular action.
2. **The true value of any action is determined by subtracting the cost of the other choice(s)**, known as the "opportunity cost."

### Personal Moral Code

A personal moral code is a more condensed system of values and actions that the individual chooses to govern their life. It takes the complexity of daily interaction with others and provides a simple guide to good values and right versus wrong action.

**KEY POINT**: Making moral choices is inherently complex because it involves balancing the good—what is valuable to me—with the right—what is valuable to others.

### A Moral Code Is a Story Code

The technique of creating a story's moral code matches the most important revolution in moral theory of the last two hundred years: Nietzsche's idea that all moral systems are created by man, not by God.

**KEY POINT**: Every moral code is also a Story Code. Moses getting the Ten Commandments is not just the "cosmic vision" plot beat found in the Book of Exodus. It is a story unto itself.

You create a moral system by using the seven major structure steps plus the various beats of the moral argument.

### Morality Beat 1: Story World - The Moral Universe

Everyone is born into a world with a highly detailed moral system already in place. This system has a major effect on how the individual creates their personal moral code.

The specific moral system that preexists the hero embodies a view of two main elements: **responsibility** and **choice**.

#### Responsibility

A moral code is a guide for how to act toward others. Therefore, it does not come into play unless someone's action directly and negatively affects someone else. Morality depends on who caused the effect.

**KEY POINT**: In our social world, individual action always occurs in a moral universe to the extent that all actions have consequences for others. A moral universe doesn't mean that people act morally. It means that all actions between people have moral consequences.

At the heart of the assessment of right versus wrong action is the element of responsibility. Before we can balance the moral accounting of who did what to whom, we must be clear about who caused the debt.

**KEY POINT**: Any moral system depends on how it defines and assesses responsibility.

**Spectrum of Responsibility Views:**

At one extreme is the **Nietzschean view** that making a promise to someone is absurd, because it suggests that humans are capable of controlling the effects of their actions into the future. According to this view, the idea that one is responsible for one's actions is an illusion, although probably a necessary one.

At the other extreme is **Jean-Paul Sartre's existential view** of extreme responsibility of the self. Because "existence precedes essence," we are what we do. This means that we are responsible for the results of our life and the moral effects we have on others. The existential view of morality and responsibility gives the individual no excuse.

The origins of Sartre's view go back at least 2,600 years, to Heraclitus's famous dictum: **"Character is destiny."**

**KEY POINT**: Being responsible for the results of our life and the moral effects we have on others has huge ramifications for the overall story process of creating and living by a moral code, and for story itself.

It gives us two rules:
1. The hero should drive the story
2. The development of this character's integrity is the true process we track in a great plot

In other words, the story tracks how the hero overcomes her moral weakness and takes right action. In structural terms, does the hero fulfill, or fail to fulfill, her moral need, which is what she must do to treat other human beings properly?

**Example - *Casablanca***: Rick goes from wanting revenge on the woman who left him and "I stick my neck out for no one" to "you need to help your husband so I can fight the Nazis."

The moral code embedded in "character is destiny" contrasts with some other types of moral system and responsibility. It means our future is not determined by fate, the gods, or what we were "born to do" (destiny), as in the classic Myth story.

**KEY POINT**: Fate, destiny, and "everything happens for a reason" are predetermined and determined by someone else. They involve an abdication of personal responsibility and have nothing to do with one's character or one's choices.

#### Choice

After responsibility, the next major characteristic of any moral system is the concept of choice. Like existentialism, "character is destiny" is necessarily about choice. Unlike fate, destiny, and "everything happening for a reason," this concept says that we determine our destiny from the quality of our character. It comes from a willingness to take responsibility.

**KEY POINT**: Once we are willing to take responsibility, we have choice. Without choice, there is no responsibility and no morality, and vice versa.

When someone becomes conscious of the centrality of choice, they transform the flow of actions into a series of choices. The result is to become conscious of the opportunity cost, the choices one is not making. This is followed by the realization of one's freedom to take a new course of action at any time.

#### TECHNIQUE: The Never-Ending Moral Challenge

Instead of borrowing the particular moral and legal system of the general society, the writer of transcendent stories creates their own.

**KEY POINT**: The most important technique for creating the finest transcendent television dramas in multiple genres is to set up a moral universe that constantly tests the moral fiber of every character in the story.

The reason this technique is found mostly in television is that the story often extends over multiple episodes and seasons. Putting the characters in a tightening moral vise is one of the best ways to build the episodes to a dramatic conclusion.

**How to execute this technique:**
1. Set the story in a world of extreme competition, defined by survival of the fittest
2. The big question all characters must face is: How does one do the right thing in a deadly arena? (Characters are always under extreme moral pressure)
3. Each episode has at least one unique moral challenge for the lead character(s)
4. These moral challenges not only define each episode, they determine how the best shows sequence their episodes in a season

### Morality Beat 2: Character Web - Moral Code

The characters, especially the hero, have certain essential beliefs and values. These values make up the hero's personal moral code and guide her actions.

A moral code is a simplified guide to good values and right versus wrong action. It balances the freedom of the individual to go after what she values—her desire—and the freedom of others not to be harmed by it.

**KEY POINT**: The crucial question in any moral code is: how much of your values are about helping yourself versus how much do you care how your actions will affect others.

#### TECHNIQUE: Executing the Moral Code

Embed the moral code over the course of the plot.

We see the moral code in moments when the character deals with a specific moral situation. The moral code affects the story in three main places:

1. **Values of the hero that are present from the beginning**
2. **In the middle**, the hero takes right and wrong actions as she tries to get her goal. During the moral argument in the middle of the story, she is forced to ask: Is this the proper means to the end I'm trying to get?
3. **The hero's final moral decision** determines whether she has moved to a higher moral level

**To apply a moral code to your story, write out a detailed code for your hero.** Do this in relation to the three pivotal moments where the character might use the moral code to determine her actions.

#### Example - *L.A. Confidential*

*L.A. Confidential* is a transcendent Detective story. It gives us an excellent example of expressing the character's moral code from the beginning. One of the lead characters is Edmund. Here his captain, Dudley Smith, questions his moral credentials for being a detective, ironically by portraying them in a negative light.

> CAPTAIN SMITH: Edmund, you're a political animal. You have the eye for human weakness, but not the stomach.
> ED EXLEY: You're wrong, sir.
> CAPTAIN SMITH: Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew to be guilty, in order to ensure an indictment?
> ED EXLEY: Dudley, we've been over this.
> CAPTAIN SMITH: Yes or no, Edmund?
> ED EXLEY: No!
> CAPTAIN SMITH: Would you be willing to beat a confession out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?
> ED EXLEY: No.
> CAPTAIN SMITH: Would you be willing to shoot a hardened criminal in the back, in order to offset the chance that some ... lawyer ...
> ED EXLEY: No.
> CAPTAIN SMITH: Then, for the love of God, don't be a detective. Stick to assignments where you don't have ...
> ED EXLEY: Dudley, I know you mean well, but I don't need to do it the way you did. Or my father.

### Morality Beat 3: Opposition - The Good vs. the Right

The hero runs up against a strong opponent who wants to prevent her from getting the goal.

Values and action are intimately connected. In the practical art of morality, they are often identical. Typically, right action depends on seeking good value. What makes the art of morality complex is when the good and the right come into opposition. This is the central trade-off, or internal opposition, in any moral code.

**KEY POINT**: The internal opposition in any moral code and moral argument is:

**ends = the good vs. means = the right**

- **The "good"** is what the individual perceives as valuable. It improves her state of being in some way. She may not be correct in her evaluation, but she starts with this perception.
- **The "right"** is relational. It is a balance between two or more entities in the social whole. A wrong action is one that harms someone else. It diminishes what is good for them.

In spite of this basic trade-off between the good and the right, the right depends on the good. Before we can decide what is a right versus wrong action, we must first make an assessment of value.

### Morality Beat 4: Plan - Values and Right and Wrong Action

The hero concocts a plan that will defeat the opponent and win the goal.

A moral code is a game plan, similar to what we would use in an Action story like war or sports. It is a guide for how to act in various situations when seeking a goal. In other words, if "x" happens, I should do "y."

Moral codes based on an all-powerful god get rid of the complexity and simply give a universal command: "You should always do 'y.' Under no circumstances should you do 'z.'" These codes are more concerned with maintaining unity through obedience to the group.

**Relative moral codes**—those not based on an all-powerful god—allow for different situations, circumstances, and exceptions. They tend to emphasize the individual over the group.

Any plan in a moral code is concerned with two major activities:
1. Assessing what makes a goal valuable
2. Assessing the right and wrong actions used to reach a goal

The game plan in a moral code is fundamentally different from the game plan in an Action story, which is strictly about how to win.

**KEY POINT**: A moral code is a game plan for how to win only desirable goals using only proper actions.

### Morality Beat 5: Drive - Assessing Ends vs. Means

Because the opponent is initially too strong, the hero becomes desperate and begins to take immoral actions to get the goal.

**KEY POINT**: When values and action, the good and the right, come into opposition, the central question of the moral argument is: Should the individual put the right above the good, others above the self?

Like other animals, the human being will often use any means required to achieve her ends. But, as the symbol-maker, the human being is the only animal that occasionally questions her own means and denies herself an end.

The decision to question one's means is a necessary step in creating an ethical code of behavior. A moral code is not relevant until a person is willing to deny herself certain actions. Without this restraint, the (im)moral system destroys both the individual and the society.

The fundamental idea that a moral code restricts desires and actions is the source of the term "the straight and narrow path." Its origin is thought to be Matthew 7:14 of the New Testament, "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life."

During the "Drive" of everyday life, the individual may struggle to assess both ends and means and how they might conflict. Every day the individual comes up with goals. Then, as she takes actions to reach them, she must assess what actions she will take to achieve them, and which actions go against her established set of values.

#### Freedom vs. Justice: The False Distinction

The moral code found in the Crime story highlights one of the great conflicts in philosophy. This is the most important issue in transcendent Crime: freedom versus justice.

On the simple level, these two definitely come into conflict. If you regulate my actions for the group, then I can't do anything I want. This normal sense of freedom assumes I'm living on a desert island, where my actions affect no one but myself. As soon as I live in society, I must consider how the actions I take to get my goal affect other human beings trying to get their goal.

**KEY POINT**: Justice is basically optimizing freedom for everyone.

#### The Story Code: Freedom vs. Justice

Just as all moral codes are story codes, the seven-step Story Code is also a moral code. It is fundamentally about the conflict between freedom and justice. The Story Code makes clear the fact that humans are free to choose and inherently concerned with the good and the right.

**KEY POINT**: The Story Code tracks a human being chasing value—"the good"—and using questionable means—"the right"—to get it.

Story magnifies this conflict between freedom and justice through drama. The hero begins with a set of values and a goal. But she doesn't just want the goal; she is obsessed with getting it. Story heightens the conflict even more by having the hero lose to the opponent through the early and middle parts of the story. This creates moral pressure as the hero must decide how far she will go to win. In desperation, she starts taking immoral actions to gain the goal. There comes a time when she decides to do anything to win. The question becomes: Is losing her morality to gain the goal a worse form of enslavement?

### Morality Beat 6: Attack by Ally - Shame and Guilt

During the middle of the story, the hero's ally attacks her by saying that he shares the hero's goal, but believes her actions to get the goal are immoral and must stop.

He gives reasons for why the hero's actions are wrong and will cause harm. But the hero does not listen at this point and instead tries to justify each act.

This "attack by ally" step in the art of morality is both a moral attack from without and an attack from within in the form of shame and guilt. Shame and guilt are two of the negatives of being the self-conscious animal. The mind punishes itself for failure and tries in vain to balance the moral accounts.

When the individual feels shame and guilt, she doesn't need defenders of society's moral system to criticize her for her immoral act. She does it quite well on her own. Plus, shame and guilt are the gift that keeps on giving. When others punish the individual, she feels she has paid her debt and can move on.

**KEY POINT**: When the individual attacks herself through shame and guilt, it is never enough no matter how hard she tries.

#### Example - *Crime and Punishment*

Like Poe's *The Tell-Tale Heart*, the hero of *Crime and Punishment* isn't driven to confess by the excellence of the police investigation. He does so because of the overwhelming fear, paranoia, and guilt he feels at killing a human being. As such, *Crime and Punishment* is one of the great "guilt culture" stories.

**KEY POINT**: In *Crime and Punishment*, the guilt is the punishment.

#### Example - *In Bruges*

In this brilliant scene of advanced moral argument, hero Ken and opponent Harry argue the good versus the just, the relative versus the absolute.

> HARRY: Let me get this right. Not only have you refused to kill the boy, you've even stopped the boy from killing himself. Which would have solved my problem. Which would have solved your problem. Which sounds like it would have solved the boy's problem.
> KEN: It wouldn't have solved his problem.
> HARRY: Ken, if I had killed a little kid, accidentally or otherwise, I wouldn't have thought twice. I'd've killed myself on the fucking spot. On the fucking spot. I'd've stuck the gun in me mouth. On the fucking spot.
> KEN: That's you, Harry. The boy has the capacity to change. The boy has the capacity to do something decent with his life.

### Morality Beat 7: Battle, Moral Self-Revelation, and Moral Decision

The "battle" moment in any moral code is the moment when the individual sees the deeper clash of value systems at stake and must decide what course of action to take.

#### Moral Self-Revelation

The moral self-revelation occurs, if at all, when the individual sees the effect of her action on others.

If it is negative, the individual realizes: "I have wronged them. I can't do whatever I want. I must make amends to try to balance the moral accounts."

The battle is the vortex point of the plot, and it makes the plot speed up as we get to the end. Similarly, the hero's final moral decision is the vortex point of the theme, and it clarifies which way of life is best, at least in this situation.

#### TECHNIQUE: Final Decision

No matter how complex the conflict of values, funnel it down to a single decision at the end. All the possible ways of living come down to the choice between two.

For the moral decision, the individual first makes a calculation of ends and means (self-revelation). Then she chooses what she thinks will have the most value, not just for herself but also for others.

**KEY POINT**: A moral decision must have two elements for it to be moral: it must affect others and it must involve a personal sacrifice by the individual, no matter which choice she makes.

The moral decision is the climax of the moral code and of any transcendent Crime story. Its main value is that it is the best way to express theme through structure. It simplifies the complex theme down to two choices: the hero acts either this way or that.

#### Example - *Crime and Punishment*

In the final sequence of actions leading up to Raskolnikov's moral self-revelation and decision, Dostoevsky makes it easy for him not to confess. First, someone else confesses to the crime. Second, the man who has overheard Raskolnikov confess to the crime commits suicide.

When Raskolnikov learns of the man's suicide at the police station, he leaves, apparently free. But Sonya, the woman he loves, who has urged him to confess, is waiting there. His moral self-revelation comes from seeing her gaze, her goodness, and her righteousness. His moral decision is to go back inside and turn himself in.

### Morality Beat 8: Thematic Revelation

A thematic revelation is where the moral code rises to another level of understanding. No longer limited to the self-revelation of one individual, the moral code grows and becomes a guideline for all people in how to live morally.

**KEY POINT**: In stories with a thematic revelation, the balancing of accounts may involve poetic justice, which is payment appropriate to that crime.

#### Moral Decision (Optional Advanced Technique)

What does the audience learn about how people in general should act? How is this drawn from the specific of characters to the general? What particular gesture or action has symbolic impact?

## Creating a Moral Code

Classic moral codes in story provide templates for creating your own. Here are some of the most important:

### The Ten Commandments

The Ten Commandments compose the most influential moral code in story history. It is an entire moral system in miniature expressed as the Exodus story. This moral code is a new vision for an entire people, and it comes at the end of the Moses story.

This moral code is a perfect expression of the dual purpose of moral systems: to proscribe desires, which are values (ends), and actions, which are means. In effect, it is a moral code that defines a vast moral argument. Five commandments refer to proper desires, and five refer to the proper actions one might take to reach a desire.

**Proper desires (ends):**
1. I am the Lord your God. You shall have no other gods before me.
2. You shall not make for yourself a carved image. You shall not bow down to them or serve them.
4. Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy.
5. Honor your father and your mother.
10. You shall not covet your neighbor's house, wife, slaves, or possessions.

**Proper actions (means):**
3. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.
6. You shall not murder.
7. You shall not commit adultery.
8. You shall not steal.
9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

### The Existential Moral Code

The Existential Code is based on the connection between identity and freedom that underlies any moral code. If the individual is what she does, she is free to choose. So she is responsible for the consequences of her actions.

The objection to the Existential Code is that it is too broad to provide advice in a shifting, relativistic world. Its guidelines are too hazy and free-form for most people to apply.

**KEY POINT**: The Existential Code simply gives the opening framework of a moral code. It says, "The choice is up to you. You must define what your moral code is. And that too will be part of your identity."

The one guideline it does give is the idea of the moral universe we just discussed. The moral universe says that because we live in a social world, one's actions always have a moral effect on others. Therefore, one is never choosing just for oneself.

The Existential Code says that whatever standards one uses for their personal moral code must be defined without appeal to an absolute god or from a book of god's rules. How one defines their moral code will be relative to multiple factors because, at its base, morality is an art form and a culture.

### The Chivalric Code

The Chivalric Code comes from the French word *chevalerie*, meaning "horse soldiering." It is a moral code that mixes two story forms: Action and Religion. The Action subgenre is the tale of the knight-errant. Its religion is Christianity.

**The central values of the chivalric code are:**
- Honor
- Courage
- Service to others
- Courtliness
- Faith
- Respect for women's safety (not as equals)

### Bushido

Like the Chivalric Code, Bushido, or the Way of the Warrior, combines Action and Religion. But here, the warrior is the samurai and the religion is Neo-Confucianism, Shinto, and Zen Buddhism.

**The seven values of Bushido are:**
- **JIN**: benevolence toward humankind; universal love; compassion
- **MAKOTO**: sincerity and truthfulness
- **CHUGI**: devotion and loyalty
- **MEIYO**: honor and glory
- **YU**: valor; bravery, tinged with heroism
- **REI**: proper behavior; courtesy
- **GI**: the right decision, taken with equanimity; rectitude

### The Code of the West

Sometimes we see moral codes for an entire genre. The Code of the West, on which the Western genre depends, is an outgrowth of living on a horse, just like the Code of Chivalry. The cowboy has been called the knight-errant of the plains.

**The values of being a knight in the Old West include:**
- Independence
- Freedom
- Self-reliance
- Courage
- Honesty
- Loyalty
- Respect for women's safety

These are the values every good cowboy believes at the beginning of the story.

### The Code of the Detective

The detective is the cowboy who has gone to the city. So it's not surprising that their codes are similar. Each is a "knight" helping others, especially the weak. But the detective is a more jaded figure who soldiers on against the never-ending immoral behavior of his/her fellow human beings. He is a dark knight, but still a knight for good in the moral relativity of the city world.

**Example - *The Maltese Falcon***: In the last scene, the detective Sam Spade gives the most famous expression of the Detective's Code in story. He is faced with the choice between love and honor, between staying with the woman he loves and sending her to jail for murder. In deciding to send her to jail, and probably to her death, Spade tells her:

> When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something about it. It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him. He was your partner and you're supposed to do something about it. And it happens we're in the detective business. Well, when one of your organization gets killed, it's bad business to let the killer get away with it, bad all around, bad for every detective everywhere.

This is as unheroic an argument for doing the right thing as we can find in genre storytelling, and it perfectly expresses the Dark Knight of the city.

### The Code of Professional Killers

**Example - *In Bruges***: A masterpiece and the epitome of the transcendent Crime Black Comedy story. *In Bruges* begins by showing the twisted but logical moral code of professional killers.

- Boss Harry had ordered Ray to assassinate a priest. In shooting the priest, Ray accidentally kills a young boy.
- To Harry, this is morally unforgivable and must be paid for in kind.
- Harry orders Ray's partner, Ken, to assassinate him.
- Ken fails to do so because he doesn't think it's right.

The moral code of the society of hit men is in direct contrast to the morality of the larger society. The larger society says that settling conflict must be done within the legal system. This benefits not only those in conflict but also other members of the society who could be hurt if the conflict spills over.

The moral code of the hit men says that, if they have been paid for a job, they have the right to settle conflict on their own. This is business, and money has the highest value. The professional killers are the executors of balancing the moral and business accounts of their clients.

Part of the hit man's code is that there must be no collateral damage, since that creates an entirely new debt. Killing a child, who is at the peak of his potential for a long and good life, creates the biggest owing of all.

This is precisely the rule and value that Ray has broken. For boss Harry, this is the true immoral action, and it is unforgivable.

Since *In Bruges* is a Crime Black Comedy (with elements of tragedy), the defenders of the larger morality, the cops, are almost nonexistent. Harry is the structural equivalent of the cop.

The story is built on the irony that the man enforcing the strict moral code is a professional killer who owns an assassination business. A further irony is that a professional killer has an absolute moral rule against killing a child.

---

## Transcendent Crime

Transcendent Crime stories explore the arts of morality and justice, as well as the contrast between what is legal and what is moral. They begin by focusing on morality, because it is the foundation of what is valuable in life.

**KEY POINT**: The main way we create our everyday morality is through story. And the main technique for doing that is the moral argument. Advanced moral argument is the primary feature of any transcendent Crime story.

### Standard vs. Transcendent Crime

The standard Crime story tracks a criminal breaking the law and the agent of society, the cop, bringing him to justice. Action-reaction-equilibrium. This is an accounting of one person's illegal and immoral actions.

The best Crime stories also show a single illegal/immoral event as the catalyst for the bigger story. But that's not the main point. They're really about moral accounting over a lifetime. These transcendent Crime stories weave a detailed and complex moral universe that tells us how human life has meaning and value.

**KEY POINT**: The moral accounting in transcendent Crime balances what one owes versus what one is owed in this life, with life-or-death stakes.

These stories are the playing out of karma on the great balance sheet of life. How payment is made and how far down the road it happens, we don't know. But payment will be made.

Transcendent Crime tends to fall into two subgenres:

### 1. Epic Crime Tragedy

**Examples**: Moses story (Old Testament), *Antigone*, *Crime and Punishment*, *Copenhagen*, *Sunset Boulevard*, *M*, *The Third Man*, *The Usual Suspects*, *The Thomas Crown Affair*, *Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri*, *Touch of Evil*, *The Dark Knight*, *Cool Hand Luke*, *Un Prophet*, *À bout de souffle* (*Breathless*), *The Wire*, *Mare of Easttown*

#### Definition

Epic Crime Tragedy depicts the master criminal hero who commits crime to prove the shallowness of the system or because of a moment of weakness.

**KEY POINT**: Tragedy is about lost potential, of what might have been. So the tragedy here comes from the fact that a clearly superior individual would waste his greatness in such a useless and destructive attempt to prove it.

By adding epic, this subgenre of Crime highlights the moral system of an entire nation.

**KEY POINT**: The Epic Crime Tragedy details the difficulty of re-creating a better moral system. It highlights how morality itself is a form of art and story, but also how it is rigid and resistant to change.

#### *Crime and Punishment*

Just as Edgar Allan Poe created the Detective story and Mary Shelley created the transcendent Horror story, Fyodor Dostoevsky created the Epic Crime Tragedy. *Crime and Punishment* defines the beats of the criminal-as-hero story.

This form transcends the genre in three ways:
1. By moving it to the level of tragedy
2. By exploring the nature of society's moral code
3. By highlighting the fundamental distinction between legal and moral crime

The societal morality expressed at the beginning of *Crime and Punishment* is similar to the Crime form: conformist, authoritarian, hierarchical, repetitive, and dull. In addition, a large underclass is mired in extreme poverty.

Hero Rodion Raskolnikov is at the same time extremely intelligent and wretchedly poor. This is a lethal combination. He has rejected society's obviously flawed morality but has replaced it with a faulty moral code of his own. His is the code of the false Overman. He performs an experiment in which killing a "useless" old woman will prove the worthlessness of the masses and his own superiority.

The defender of the larger morality's values is the cop investigating the murder (actually two murders), Porfiry Petrovich. Like Marge Gunderson in *Fargo*, he is an average person but extremely good at his job. He is also Raskolnikov's equal in philosophical combat.

Unlike the hero's actions in the typical Crime story, Raskolnikov does surprisingly little to defeat the cop. In fact, many of his actions implicate him in the crime. This is not a master criminal like Thomas Crown, who wants to expose the incompetence of the authorities and prove his brilliance. This is a man paralyzed by deep guilt.

The story spends relatively little time on the mechanics of crime solving. Instead, it is primarily a moral and emotional struggle Raskolnikov has with himself and those he loves.

**KEY POINT**: In *Crime and Punishment*, Raskolnikov's mind serves as the courtroom in which he sentences himself for the moral crime he has committed.

The sequence of actions is not the usual one of the hero becoming more immoral over the course of the story. It is the reverse, a sequence of him going from immoral killer to moral confession.

#### *Atonement*: The Impossible Atonement

It has been argued that it's impossible to write a modern tragedy. The question is: How can the common man suffer a tragic fall? Dostoevsky tried to answer the question by defining the Epic Crime Tragedy with a hero of extraordinary intelligence and potential who destroys it all by committing a senseless murder.

*Atonement* is a modern tragedy combining Epic Crime Tragedy with Love. The story begins with a single immoral event that ripples out to destroy two lives and cripple a third. The criminal is thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis, who wrongly accuses her sister's boyfriend of rape. The story then plays out how this decision affects the wronged man, the woman he loves, and the girl who made the accusation.

What are Briony's excuses? Was it fate? Was it her destiny? Did it happen for a reason? Did she simply not understand sexuality? We could excuse her by saying she was young, she was mad at him, she didn't mean for it to get out of hand. But none of that matters. "Character is destiny," and her character, her integrity, was defective.

The key storytelling technique in *Atonement* is the surprise of who is telling this story. Until the end, it has seemed to be primarily about the wronged man. But he didn't act immorally. It is the girl who told the lie. She is the one who must somehow fix the imbalance in the moral order that has lasted sixty years.

At the end Briony tries to atone by making another choice: to write a novel about what happened and take responsibility for it. So the story concludes with her as an old woman, being interviewed for her novel titled "Atonement." Now she will try to tell the story for good, to give the lovers, through fiction, the lives they never had. She tells the story to apologize, even though there are some moral accounts in this life that can never be made right.

The tragedy is that it's too late. Briony can't bring them back and it ruined her life as well. That's the heartbreaking tragedy of what might have been. The writers use the Love story form to heighten the tragedy even further. It is not just the way the immoral act hurts these individuals, but how it prevents the blossoming of a great love.

### 2. Crime Black Comedy

**Examples**: *Breaking Bad*, *Parasite*, *In Bruges*, *Blood Simple*, *Fargo* (film and television), *No Country for Old Men*, *Goodfellas*

True tragedy is rare in any form of modern storytelling, so modern versions of transcendent Crime are usually done as Black Comedy.

**KEY POINT**: The Black Comedy version of transcendent Crime shows how the moral code can be a destructive system. It tracks a story in which the combination of extreme passion and lack of knowledge creates a deadly world and a downward cycle where even love kills.

#### *Parasite*

*Parasite* is a transcendent Crime story that balances the books on an inherently corrupt capitalist/class system. With elements that go back as far as *Crime and Punishment* and *High and Low*, this film uses a structural sequence similar to the old proverb "For want of a nail the shoe was lost ..." What is unique here is not the crime or the punishment, but the comical karmic trip that gets to the punishment.

#### *Breaking Bad*

It is impossible to exaggerate the artistic accomplishment of *Breaking Bad* as a transcendent Crime Black Comedy story. It is also one of the finest television shows in history and one of the great works of art of the twenty-first century.

Transcendent Crime, whether Epic Tragedy or Black Comedy, has to do with moral accounting over a lifetime: what you owe versus what you are owed in life, with life-and-death stakes.

The storylines in *Breaking Bad* are the playing out of karma on a vast scale through a terrible comedy of errors. On the great balance sheet of life, payment will be made. How it's made and how far down the road, we don't know.

**What Walter White is owed:**
- Walt feels he was cheated out of his share of what became a billion-dollar chemical business. He believes he is a genius and deserves to be a rich businessman, praised for the genius he is.
- Because he has cancer, he believes he has the right to make and sell drugs so his family will be taken care of after he's gone.

**What he owes:**
- He is making high-grade meth that is destructive to those who use it
- A rival gang kills one of his sellers, Combo
- He lets his partner's girlfriend die when he could have saved her
- He kills countless people, some guilty and some innocent, some in a premeditated way and some through negligence

**Character Arc:**
Hero Walter White is a complex and contradictory character, defined primarily as someone with a highly compartmentalized moral code. In many ways Walt is a good man. But he also does terrible things, which he rationalizes with one of the show's taglines: "You did what you had to do to protect your family."

**KEY POINT**: Because the hero starts as a normal and moral person, the viewer cannot see him in terms of the Crime or Gangster stereotype.

This is not *The Godfather* or *The Sopranos*. Walt is not a gangster, not one of "those" people. In American Gangster stories, "those" people is code for poor Italian American immigrants. No, the viewer sees that Walt is me. He's as "normal" as I am. So I, the viewer, go down the road with him.

One of the keys to the greatness of *Breaking Bad* is that Walt's character change is embedded right in the original premise of the show. Show creator Vince Gilligan said, "What was interesting to me was a straight arrow character who decides to make a radical change in his life and goes from being a protagonist to an antagonist." In his initial pitch to Sony Pictures, he said, "I want to take Mr. Chips and turn him into Scarface over the life of the series."

**KEY POINT**: The entire show expresses what I believe is the most important technique in all of story: plot comes from character.

Walt begins as a brilliant but nebbishy normal guy. But he changes into someone hooked on monetary success and the intellectual game. As a result, his character over the series goes from nebbish to assertive to feeling that he is an artist, the self-proclaimed master chef, "Heisenberg" (one of the towering geniuses of quantum mechanics).

**KEY POINT**: Walt starts as Dr. Jekyll, becomes Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and by the end of the series he's just Mr. Hyde.

**Serial Structure:**
Besides its unique premise and complex character, a big reason why *Breaking Bad* is one of the best shows ever is the ability of the writers to sequence plot over the course of the season. On a show with a serial structure, this may be the most important talent a television writer can have.

**KEY POINT**: Serial story structure in television changes a show's unit of measure from the episode to the season. It's all about building the stories, building the episodes to a climactic season finale. The writers of *Breaking Bad* build the moral decisions sequentially, in this case negatively.

Like *The Dark Knight*, plot over the course of each season is determined primarily by the sequence of the hero's moral decisions. Walt's moral decisions get progressively worse. We watch him pave the road to hell one brick at a time.

**KEY POINT**: Crime is what the writers use to give this everyman a series of moral tests, which he flunks as they slowly tighten the moral vise over the course of the show.

Walt goes from killing a man but being justified, to letting his partner's girlfriend choke to death, to killing a number of men in a premeditated way.

Staff writer George Mastras said: "One of our biggest debates was about Jesse's girlfriend, when Walt lets her aspirate. How far can we push this guy toward darkness and not lose the audience? He's still doing this for good reasons, but he's doing horrible things."

**This may be the key line of this or any great television series: How far can we push the hero toward darkness and not lose the audience?**

And what is the final moral accounting in this masterpiece of Crime Black Comedy? Walt's attempts to square the books destroy the love between him and his family and lead to his death and the deaths of countless other human beings.

#### *In Bruges*

*In Bruges* is one of the finest transcendent Crime stories ever made. The end of *In Bruges* is one of the best examples of moral code, moral argument, and poetic justice in all of story.

The power of the ending comes from the moral code that boss Harry states early in the story:

> HARRY: Ken, if I had killed a little kid, accidentally or otherwise, I wouldn't have thought twice. I'd've killed myself on the fucking spot. On the fucking spot. I'd've stuck the gun in me mouth. On the fucking spot!

**Battle and Ken's Moral Decision 1**: The final battle occurs at the top of the tower. Ken expects Harry to murder him for his failure to kill his partner. With Harry's gun pointed right at him, Ken makes his first of two moral decisions in the story's finale. He pushes his gun along the ledge to Harry.

**KEY POINT**: Ken accepts Harry's moral accounting for himself, but not for Ray.

> KEN: Harry, I'm totally in your debt. Things that have gone between us in the past, I love you unreservedly for all that.
> [Harry lowers his gun.]
> HARRY: What?
> KEN: For your integrity. For your honor. I love you. The boy had to be let go. The boy had to be given a chance. And to do that, I had to say fuck you, and fuck what I owe you, and fuck everything that's gone between us. And that's what I had to do. I'm not fighting you. And I accept everything totally you're gonna do. I accept it. Totally ...
> HARRY: Well you say all that fucking stuff I can't fucking shoot you now, can I ...
> [Harry shoots Ken in the leg.]
> HARRY: You think I'm going to do nothing to you just because you're standing about like Robert fucking Powell ... out of Jesus of fucking Nazareth.

Harry and Ken have made a deal. The debt is wiped clean. The books are even.

**KEY POINT**: What follows is one of the most transcendent scenes in film history and should be studied closely by any fiction writer.

Harry is helping Ken down the steps. Eirik runs up to them near the top and tells Harry that Ray is down in the street below.

**Harry's Moral Decision 1**: Suddenly, the deal is off. Harry will now try to kill Ray. Ken goes for his gun but Harry pulls his first. They fight. Harry is too strong. He turns the gun toward Ken and shoots him in the neck.

Harry is devastated at what he has done, but returns to his moral code. "I'm sorry, Ken. But you can't kill a kid and expect to get away with it. You just can't."

**Ken's Moral Decision 2**: Harry runs down the steps while Ken drags his limp body back up the steps and across the floor. A wide swath of blood trails behind him. His plan is to yell down to Ray to warn him of the danger. But when he struggles to look over the ledge of the tower, he sees that the entire plaza below is locked in fog!

What can he do? Meanwhile, in the plaza, Ray is enamored with his new girlfriend. As Harry hurries down the steps, Ken buttons his gun in his coat and drops coins like rain into the plaza below. At first we don't know why. As the coins hit, people back away. Ray and his girlfriend take notice. Now standing on the ledge, Ken steels himself and jumps.

The body splats on the stone floor. Ray rushes to his friend. Incredibly, Ken is still alive. "Harry's here. Take my gun." And he dies. But the gun has broken in the fall.

In jumping to his death to try to save Ray, Ken has made the ultimate Moral Decision and sacrifice. This has the power of a cosmic reversal.

**Harry's Self-Revelation and Final Moral Decision**: Now comes the self-revelation and moral decision of the main opponent. Harry chases Ray through the streets of Bruges. Finally, he traps him on a plaza where a film crew is shooting a movie. One of the actors is a dwarf, dressed as a schoolboy, whom Ray has come to know over the course of the story. Ray, with a bullet in him, staggers forward. He sees the dwarf from behind and thinks it's the ghost of the boy he shot.

> RAY: The little boy.
> HARRY: That's right, Ray. The little boy.
> [Harry shoots Ray three more times in the back. Ray crawls to the dwarf, who has been shot by one of Harry's bullets. Harry thinks he has killed a child.]
> HARRY: Ah. I see.
> [Based on that self-revelation and confronted by his own moral code, Harry places the gun in his mouth.]
> RAY: It's not ...
> HARRY: You've got to stick to your principles.
> [He puts the gun back in his mouth and blows his head off.]

Harry's self-revelation, "Ah, I see," has just shown him he was too rigid in his principles. But those principles are absolute and have become an ideology frozen in his mind. Harry can't change. He has to walk the talk of his code, and so makes the final Moral Decision to take his own life.

**KEY POINT**: To execute the big moral decision at the end, the character must clearly express their moral code early in the story.

This outcome is one of the great examples of poetic justice. The writer-director Martin McDonagh has re-created exactly the moral ambiguity of Ray's killing of the boy. Now, by his own hand, Harry must accept the same justice he demanded for Ray.

This is great writing and it's what makes *In Bruges* one of the finest transcendent Crime stories ever made.

## Key Techniques

### Ingenious Crime

Because the story often tracks the master criminal, whether hero or opponent, make the crime ingenious. The crime is the expression in action of the brilliance of the criminal's mind and artistry.

### Deception

**KEY POINT**: The more deception the criminal uses, the better the Crime story will be.

### Obsessive Cop

During the Drive step, show the cop becoming obsessed and going too far to catch the criminal, thus acting like the criminal. This technique blends two characters the audience thinks are opposites.

### Criminal Hero Partially Justified

Make the criminal at least partially justified in breaking the law to get what they want. This makes the criminal hero more complex and appealing, and makes the cop torn between catching the criminal and wanting them to succeed.

### Opponent's Plan

Most writers miss this. The more intricate the opponent's plan, and the better it's hidden, the better the plot will be.

### Deceptive Attack

Make both cop and criminal masters of the game by using deception where each surprises the other and the audience.

### Plot Carries Moral Argument

Express moral argument through plot, not heavy-handed theme. Hero commits illegal act, then another to cover it up, leading to tighter moral bind.

### Final Reveal

Plan reveals at the beginning of the story. Make each part of the opponent's overall, interconnected campaign of attack. The closer you push the big reveal to the end, the better.

### The Never-Ending Moral Challenge

Set up a moral universe that constantly tests the moral fiber of every character. Each episode/section has at least one unique moral challenge. Best technique for transcendent television drama.

### Final Decision

No matter how complex the conflict of values, funnel it down to a single decision at the end between two choices.

### Poetic Justice

Payment in kind, payment unique to that crime, karmic reckoning, or payment by offender's own hand.
